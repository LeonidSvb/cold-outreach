From Virginia to Texas and everywhere in between, our only goal is to deliver the highest skilled craft workers available to valued clients.  We made a very conscious and deliberate decision early on to work exclusively in this industry in order to become experts and be capable of producing results beyond standard recruiting agencies' abilities.  \n\nThe Dutch Resources Difference\n\nPut simply, we are at the top of our industry because we all have worked for major Industrial Construction companies recently.  When we speak to you, we understand your projects, scope of work, and the value in making sure the work gets done on budget, on schedule, and safely.  Having experience in projects like yours allows us to understand the work being done, the potential risks, and most importantly, the necessary skills our workers will need in order to be successful at your site.  To sum it up, we know the difference between Mechanical and Precision Millwrights, Journeymen Industrial and Commercial Electricians and Helpers, and Stick and TIG Welders (and a lot more).  There will be no surprises and no disappointments when we help staff your project.\n\nWorkers\n\nA craft staffing company is only as good as the workers they deploy.  Our workers are our most valuable assets.  By maintaining relationships with proven resources, we generally do not need to run open recruiting campaigns.  Our reputation and future rests in the quality of workers we send so great care in taken to ensure you get people we have used and trust.  The quality of our workers, speed of deployment, and ability to get large numbers of multiple crafts is what set us apart from the competition.",
