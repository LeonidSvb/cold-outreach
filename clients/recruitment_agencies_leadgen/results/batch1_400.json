We have worked in Corporate America and understand both of our clients and candidates.\n\nTypically, the best candidates we see are those that you can't find on job boards. Most recruiting firms have the same recruiting tools but we are much different.  Right Choice Resources employees have a large network so the majority of candidates we place are in our network. Therefore, we know they're not just good interviewers because in many cases, we know them personally or know people that do.\n\nWe go after the cream of the crop employees who are loved by their bosses and aren't looking to make a move.  Since most of have been top employees, we show them that although they are working a great job, why it makes sense to be open to a conversation.\n\nIn addition, we don't take on every client that contacts us.  If it's outside of our expertise or we don't believe we can deliver candidates, we take a polite pass and/or refer it over to another company we recommend.",

  "company_description": "Visium Resources, Inc. was established in 2002 to service the staffing needs of commercial and government organizations throughout Florida and the Southeastern USA, and how it came to be is an interesting story. The Company was founded by a very experienced team of Staffing Industry professionals whose roots in the Temp staffing industry extend all the way back to the 1950's and 60's.\n\nAfter individually creating, building, and managing their respective Staffing organizations, the two founders ultimately sold their organizations in the late 90's and retired to what they thought would be the \"Good Life\". Having spent many years serving together as Directors of a national industry Trade Organization they stayed in touch, and when retirement lost its luster, they decided to meld their skills and actively go back into the industry they both knew and loved. From that decision flowed Visium Resources Inc. A new organization that would take advantage of the industries newest technologies for the sake of efficiency, but had at its core, the principle of doing business on a very personal level, Personal, meaning People to People. With that guiding Core Principle, Visium has imbued its staff with the concept that our way of doing business is to be based on the premise that in every business transaction, we are always serving two customers. Customer one is our Client Company, of course, but customer two shall always be our valued Contract Employees. Both Customers are considered a virtual extension of the Visium \"Family\". After well over a decade of history behind us, it is safe to say that the application of that Core Principle has been validated,….. and it shall always be so. It is Our Way.",
