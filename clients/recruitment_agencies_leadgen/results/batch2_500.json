  "company_description": "Ultimate Banking was born from the desire of our two Directors to provide a service that they felt was missing from the recruitment market place. Our aim was, and remains, to work solely with a select group of niche mortgage and personal loan lenders and directly associated businesses. We recruit people that not only understand this highly specialised market but who also hold the same values as our customer-focussed clients. Our clients manually underwrite loans rather than 'tick box' lending and this area of financial services is vital to a large proportion of people seeking mortgages and personal loans, without them many would struggle to find a mortgage at all, much less a competitively priced one. \n\nWe are truly passionate about this market and that is why we do not operate in any other sectors: we love what we do. Many things have changed since 2008 but one thing certainly hasn't and that is our commitment to both our candidates and our clients - we do not pretend to be experts in everything - we are specialist in the mortgage market - if we can't do something we will say so. Much like our clients, we are not a 'computer says no' agency.  Despite technology overrunning the workplace we believe recruitment (much like lending), at its heart, is still about people and relationships. It's good to talk and that makes us pretty unique we think.\n\nTo see the full range of our services please visit our website.",

By following a robust but flexible methodology coupled with state-of-the-art recruitment technology we access talent pools and enable conversations that our clients would miss out on otherwise.\n\nTransparency and professionalism are also core features of our approach and we are committed to always providing an exceptional client and candidate experience. \n\nOUR HISTORY\n\nWhilst 2020 has changed the World forever, STOIX saw huge opportunities for a different brand of modern Search Partner. With the 9 to 5 facing extinction and 5 days in the office an ongoing debate, the ability to work remotely has changed the game for many of us. Top talent can be based anywhere and for some, work whenever. We believe we are well placed to harness this and deploy it to our customers who want to attract the best and ensure they are well placed to recover and grow in a post-pandemic world and beyond. \n\nOUR NAME\n\n\"A Stoic is someone who transforms fear into prudence, pain into transformation, mistakes into initiation, and desire into undertaking.\" ― Taleb Nassim Nicholas\n\nThe name STOIX was influenced by the ancient Greek and Roman philosophy of Stoicism. We believe that in today's fast-paced world, Stoic philosophy is more relevant than ever. We are big on self-development and strive to let the four Stoic virtues of Wisdom, Courage, Temperance, and Justice guide our actions.",
