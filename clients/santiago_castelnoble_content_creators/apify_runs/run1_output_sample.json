My focus is on small business web design.\n\nI've been doing web design and small business marketing for over two decades, this is my full-time business (not something I do \"on the side\"), and I am located in the U.S. (Southern New Jersey).\n\nYou will work directly with me (Teri Brooks), not a member of a corporation that treats you like a number. And I do ALL the work myself... NO outsourcing!\nYou will own your website, and your domain name will be under YOUR name, not mine.\n\nI won't lock you into an annual contract for your website, and I don't charge monthly fees for your website unless you choose to pay that way.\n\nI don't cut corners. I'll manually \"hand-code\" your website from scratch instead of using template websites like WordPress, as most web designers do. Hand-coded websites are more search friendly, more customizable, and less vulnerable to security issues.\n\nI won't \"drop the ball\", and I'll answer the phone or call you back right away. And because I know you have a hectic schedule, I will contact you to get information to complete your website, rather than you having to remind me.",
