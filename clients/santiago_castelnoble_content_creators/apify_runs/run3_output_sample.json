We offer motivational speaking and training in a variety of areas including customer service, communication, leadership, and dealing with change.\n\nTwo of our most popular programs:\n\nMotivation by Chocolate\n\nThis session features two things everyone likes – chocolate and motivation!  It teaches nine key motivational concepts that can help participants get more out of every day – both personally and professionally.  They'll learn about persistence, passion, effective allocation of resources, the law of diminishing returns, and much more!  The session includes a chocolate tasting to demonstrate not only how to appreciate chocolate, but life itself.  \n\nHow to Communicate with Everyone Who is Not You\n\nLife would be so easy if everyone we interacted with was just like us. They would understand our cryptic e-mail messages, forgive our bizarre text messages, and understand why we unfriended them on Facebook. There would be no hard feelings, no conflict, and clearly, world peace. Unfortunately, no one else is exactly like you and to succeed in life and business, you have to work with the frustrating, the angry, the silly, and yes, even the smarter and more articulate. This session will help you do just that. You will learn about barriers to communication and how to remove them. You'll get tips on defusing hostile people (especially helpful for those in customer service or divorce court). You'll take a communication styles quiz and find out just how different a large portion of the world really is and how to get along with them. There will be tips on technology and how to be more effective when using it to communicate. And you'll even improve your listening skills (not that anyone has better ideas than you, but they might have more information). People won't stop being different, but this session will help you understand them.",
