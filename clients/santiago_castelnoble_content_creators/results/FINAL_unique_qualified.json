    "company_description": "In 2019, I used my layoff from GE as an opportunity to transform my life.  One aspect of that was through moving to a low carb lifestyle, which has resulted in me losing over 70 lbs and getting off of blood pressure medication for the first time in two decades.  I also tapped into my passion for training and cooking to create SeriousKeto.\n\nSince then, SeriousKeto has become one of the top 1/2 of 1% of ALL YouTube channels and has over 200K social media subscribers/followers.  On any given day, my content is viewed by 20K to 30K individuals, as I share recipes, motivation and inspiration to people who want to take control of their health naturally.\n\nIt's been so rewarding to get comments, messages and emails daily from my followers, thanking me for helping them lose weight, conquer diabetes, eliminate inflammation, and get off of prescription medications.  I also get the opportunity to fight the immense amounts of misinformation propagated by the media, big food, and big pharma about the many health benefits of a low carb lifestyle.",

Content marketing is the best way to build a profitable business because it generates low-cost clicks and high-margin customers. We built our company with it, and we've helped thousands of others do the same.\n\n2. It's also one of the best ways for a person to build a happy life. That might sound a bit corny to you, but it's true. When you show the world who you are at scale, you attract incredible opportunities on autopilot.\n\n3. Being a content creator isn't enough. That'll get you a lot of likes, followers, and search clicks, but it won't pay your bills. Instead, you need to be a Copy Creator who generates tons of attention and profit.\n\n4. The vast majority of marketing blogs and gurus give you way too little and charge you way too much. We give you course-quality information for free and paid offers that are legitimately game-changing.\n\nIf those resonate with you, join our newsletter.",

She is an expert digital storyteller and social media strategist — creating both visual, verbal and written content for various clients throughout the food and hospitality industry. Some past and present clients include Adobe, BeachBound, Don Angie, Explore Kissaki, Jollibee, Marriott, Norweigan Cruise Line, Resorts World, SPAM, Visit Finland, Visit Laguna Beach, and VIsit Portugal. Her work spans from garnering a million impressions on social media through a sponsored culinary & culture trip in Israel to helping drive $2 million+ in DTC sales through content marketing for Momofuku Goods, the hospitality group's new line of business with restaurant-grade pantry essentials. \n\nCaitlin is also a builder of genuine community — she has not only built her own audience and following, she helps other businesses create loyal and engaged communities. Her focused tactics include nurturing influencer relationships for brand awareness, hosting impact-driven influencer and community events, carving out distinct spaces for VIP communities to connect and receive lifetime value, creating social dialogue and trendspotting.",

    "company_description": "Neal Schaffer created his social media strategy consultancy Windmills Marketing DBA NealSchaffer.com and PDCA Social to fill a gap that brands and companies have between their willingness to effectively implement social media throughout their organization and their ability to do so. Neal believed the answer to this problem is two-fold: 1) Many companies simply lacked the experience of working deeply with social media platforms and/or were not maximizing the full functionality they provided and 2) Companies lack a strategy and structure for which to govern the everyday activities of their social efforts and tie it in with the ROI for whatever strategic corporate objective they have. Neal, therefore, created a unique and completely proprietary social media strategy consulting program which, combined with his social media coaching and training, has helped dozens of companies better leverage and strategically utilize social media for a variety of objectives, including marketing, sales, business development, customer service, reputation management, and crisis management. The proprietary framework and process used to develop a social media strategy forms the basis of Neal's book Maximize Your Social.\n\nNeal's firm provides the following social media consulting services:\n\nSocial Media Strategy Consulting\n\nSocial Media Coaching\n\nSocial Media Training and Workshops",

Company founder Michael Ramirez recognized the need for a different kind of SEO company shortly after landing his first job at an interactive advertising agency.\n\nHaving received a Degree in Advertising from The University of Texas at Austin, he quickly realized that many standard SEO practices went against the traditional lessons of marketing – essentially giving the customers what they wanted, when they wanted it and how they wanted it.\n\nSo Michael set about creating a new approach that provided tangible SEO results without sacrificing the customer experience. And the new approach worked.\n\nWith each campaign Michael implemented, measured and evolved the approach, applying traditional marketing principles and strategies to the world of SEO. After getting consistently exceptional results for local, national and international clients in a variety of industries, it became clear. Online advertising in the hands of a creative marketing mind was far superior to the standard SEO strategies that solely targeted search results.\n\nThis evolution of traditional and modern marketing is now the basis of SearchRPM.",

For SCM, Community Marketing is about content strategy that seeks to drive connection over clicks. We view content as the vital bridge that connects brands with their audience. \n\nOur journey began with the recognition that the creative aspect is responsible for driving up to 70% of campaign performance, yet continues to be an under-serviced area. SCM drives connection by developing content that is entertaining, relatable, and worthy of our audience's attention. \n\nPartnering with brands like Jack In The Box, P&G, Neutrogena, K18 Hair, Youth To The People, Intuit, and Keebler  - our approach is backed by social trend data, music science, and audience insights to give brand content a \"sticky\" factor that has helped our clients to stand out amongst their category and be remembered and beloved within their communities.

Employees want to work for a company that is having a positive impact. Employees expect the companies they work for to do more. Consumers expect companies to take a stand on issues that are close to their hearts. There is a huge opportunity available for companies to support non-profits & help solve social issues. \n\nSo how can your company \"do good\" at a time where there is so much virtue-signaling, cause-washing & green-washing? \n\nWhether it's a moment or a movement, it has to have real impact. It's not just performative. It's about the action taken that goes along with the messaging. \n\nSteph Belsky & Alana Ficalora are shining a light on campaigns & events that missed an opportunity for maximum social impact, often leaving money on the table, as well as highlighting those that are doing it right. \n\nOur monthly virtual series in now a podcast.

Innovative companies enjoy higher profits when they introduce new products and services, before competition occurs, experience higher market share, and sustain consistent high profits over time because they continue to deliver new products and services ahead of their competitors. Research showed that market shares of innovators were 3 times higher, sales were 6 times higher, and EBIT Margins were 10% better than average companies. During recession, these margins could be 50% better than average. Over time, the profitability of innovative companies was 35% to 80% better than non-innovative companies. \n\nOur starting point is that all employees are capable of high degrees of creativity, and that the organization restricts that creativity due its culture. Hiring more creative people or acquiring companies with innovative products or services is not as effective as increasing the level of creativity with the existing employees to their potential. The process includes the creation of creativity-supportive environment, individual creativity training, team and team leader processes, and finally effective implementation mechanism to turn creative ideas into innovative products, services, and processes.",

Our approach means that Goods Agency and client grow together in unison, and we are ultimately rewarded when you start to see the fruits of our work benefit your business.

We also offer tailored support for these caring adults, providing them with the skills, strategies, and insights needed to foster a positive and supportive environment. By empowering those closest to the child, we create a network of resilience that extends far beyond our coaching sessions.\nOur twin founders bring a unique blend of expertise and passion to The Wee Coaching Company. With their rich backgrounds in education and health, they have crafted a holistic approach that combines professional knowledge with a personal touch.

Time and prioritisation is a crucial factor when it comes to personal development and by failing to manage it, we can often become overwhelmed with our day to day. \n\nFor this reason, we created an online platform the provides animated content for coaches and players that would save them time and inspire individuals to be creative in their work. By producing practices, sessions, formations and tactical solutions that can be applied to all age groups and adapted to meet player's needs has been our aim. \n\nAs the platform has grown and we have seen the influence on coaches and player's worldwide we have listened to users and attempted to create a platform that meets user needs.\n\n1. New App developed for IOS and Android for Mobile and Tablet\n2. Developed a new, quicker platform at app.touchtight.com with better search and filter options\n\nWe have listened to questions from many coaches about how we can support clubs and create videos themselves and so just to say without giving too much away, \"We are listening!\"\n\nRight, I hope that gives you some understanding of Touchtight. My name is Leon and I played Semi Pro for over 10 years (not quite good enough), was a teacher for many years (for my sins) and now an A Licence Coach (does that mean much now?!). My biggest advice is to prioritise every single day and manage your time wisely and focus on making a positive difference wherever, whenever and however you can.\n\nYou Can Find Us Here...\n► Website: https://touchtight.com and app.touchtight.com\n► Instagram: https://instagram.com/touchtightcoach\n► Twitter: https://twitter.com/touchtightcoach\n► Facebook: https://facebook.com/touchtight/\n► YouTube: https://youtube.com/c/touchtight\n\nThanks for connecting and look forward to communicating more in the future!",

    "company_description": "Discussing Mental Health is a beacon of hope in the world of mental well-being.\n\nInspiration and Mission: This journey began with a deep-rooted frustration over the inadequate support available for those struggling with mental health issues. Waiting times were unacceptably long, and private therapy was often financially out of reach. But instead of simply lamenting these challenges, we decided to be a force for change. Our mission was to provide a lifeline for those suffering in silence.\n\nA Personal Journey: The connection to mental health wasn't merely professional. It was deeply personal. CEO and Founder Stephanie Bashford's path to recovery included the integration of exercise, and she passionately shared her experiences through the \"Discussing Mental Health\" podcast. The project took a poignant turn during the pandemic when Stephanie lost her younger brother to medication prescribed for his mental health conditions. This heartbreaking event fueled her commitment to helping others who faced similar struggles. Stephanie was determined to make a difference.\n\nA Unique Approach: \"Discussing Mental Health\" is not just another mental health initiative. It's a fresh, unique, and innovative combination of talking therapy and exercise. This approach offers a holistic way to address mental well-being, recognising the undeniable link between physical activity and mental health.\n\nCommunity Impact: The ultimate vision is to make mental health support accessible to as many citizens as possible. \n\nRegistered Company No: 14174609",

    "company_description": "Why did we open a music recording and podcast studio in Maidenhead? My name is Tarun Puri and I am the owner and founder of Sherwood Studios.\n\n\"My passion for music came from being sat in a recording session many years ago, watching my sister perform a demo of one of her songs at the time. The concept of being able to create something from nothing, whilst telling your own story is something special because music can be extremely powerful, in helping you find your own identity which can be hard for young people in todays society. There is a constant pressure to compare yourself with others on social media, which can be harmful in focusing on your own journey and development. Sherwood Studios provides a space, where your artistic growth and peace of mind is our primary concern\". \n\nTarun has been making music for over five years, amassing over four million streams on Spotify alone. Having a strong support network really helped Tarun in building a loyal fan base. This is something that Sherwood Studios wants to emphasise, birthing its very own creative community in Maidenhead. In fact, there is a lot of talent in Maidenhead and its surrounding areas that is ready to be developed and elevated. That's why the team had such an appetite to open a studio in Maidenhead. Tarun's music has given him the platform to work alongside a number of different charities, such as Young Minds, Child Bereavement UK and Cardiac Risk in the Young. From this, they raised over £5000 in the process. Sherwood Studios believes that music and video production should always tell a story. We are dedicated to telling your story.\n\nWe feel blessed to be able to work with such talented creatives in the music and podcast space, as we feel part of their journey. It's very important to us that we create an experience and a product that is bespoke, tailored to each individual and their specific requirements. \n\nThe team is now constantly growing & we can't wait to see what the future holds for us.",
