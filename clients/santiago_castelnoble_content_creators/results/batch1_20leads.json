  "company_description": "In 2019, I used my layoff from GE as an opportunity to transform my life.  One aspect of that was through moving to a low carb lifestyle, which has resulted in me losing over 70 lbs and getting off of blood pressure medication for the first time in two decades.  I also tapped into my passion for training and cooking to create SeriousKeto.\n\nSince then, SeriousKeto has become one of the top 1/2 of 1% of ALL YouTube channels and has over 200K social media subscribers/followers.  On any given day, my content is viewed by 20K to 30K individuals, as I share recipes, motivation and inspiration to people who want to take control of their health naturally.\n\nIt's been so rewarding to get comments, messages and emails daily from my followers, thanking me for helping them lose weight, conquer diabetes, eliminate inflammation, and get off of prescription medications.  I also get the opportunity to fight the immense amounts of misinformation propagated by the media, big food, and big pharma about the many health benefits of a low carb lifestyle.",

After numerous NHL events and literally hundreds of blog articles Inside Edge Hockey News started doing podcasts.  As the years went on the blog articles were taken over by podcasts.  In 2021, Inside Edge Hockey News became Inside Edge Hockey Media Group.  A National Hockey League media company.  Featuring a professional hockey podcast centered around the Calgary Flames. Flames Unfiltered is entering its sixth season.  The latest venture is a hockey podcast network called Talkin Hockey. It is currently in the works and will feature hockey podcast all in one spot, a hockey podcaster networking site and a 24/7 hockey radio channel.   The Inside Edge Hockey Media Group is a credentialed National Hockey League media member.",
