Choosing the right influencers for your brand can be tough. But that's where we come in to help. We have a network of influencers from a huge variety of backgrounds. Each with their own skillset and based in a certain area. You name an area, there is going to be an influencer available. We help connect your brand to the right consumer.\n\nInfluencer marketing is becoming one of the most effective ways of bringing your brand to a personal level of which consumers can trust. We can bring these influencers to work with your brand to help make your brand and products resonate with your target audience.\n\nWe are different to regular influencer networks and agencies. This is because we specialise in working with brands from engineering backgrounds. Anything to do with transportation or engineering is what we love and so do our influencers. We won't just provide an influencer on their reach. We measure their engagement to make sure it suits the brands wants and needs and also the influencers.\n\n👉  https://fourstroke.media/  👈",

Our approach means that Goods Agency and client grow together in unison, and we are ultimately rewarded when you start to see the fruits of our work benefit your business.

  "company_description": "Touchtight Coaching was created in 2016, with the hope to create content that would support coaches and players in their development. Time and prioritisation is a crucial factor when it comes to personal development and by failing to manage it, we can often become overwhelmed with our day to day. \n\nFor this reason, we created an online platform the provides animated content for coaches and players that would save them time and inspire individuals to be creative in their work. By producing practices, sessions, formations and tactical solutions that can be applied to all age groups and adapted to meet player's needs has been our aim. \n\nAs the platform has grown and we have seen the influence on coaches and player's worldwide we have listened to users and attempted to create a platform that meets user needs.\n\n1. New App developed for IOS and Android for Mobile and Tablet\n2. Developed a new, quicker platform at app.touchtight.com with better search and filter options\n\nWe have listened to questions from many coaches about how we can support clubs and create videos themselves and so just to say without giving too much away, \"We are listening!\"\n\nRight, I hope that gives you some understanding of Touchtight. My name is Leon and I played Semi Pro for over 10 years (not quite good enough), was a teacher for many years (for my sins) and now an A Licence Coach (does that mean much now?!). My biggest advice is to prioritise every single day and manage your time wisely and focus on making a positive difference wherever, whenever and however you can.\n\nYou Can Find Us Here...\n► Website: https://touchtight.com and app.touchtight.com\n► Instagram: https://instagram.com/touchtightcoach\n► Twitter: https://twitter.com/touchtightcoach\n► Facebook: https://facebook.com/touchtight/\n► YouTube: https://youtube.com/c/touchtight\n\nThanks for connecting and look forward to communicating more in the future!",

Waiting times were unacceptably long, and private therapy was often financially out of reach. But instead of simply lamenting these challenges, we decided to be a force for change. Our mission was to provide a lifeline for those suffering in silence.\n\nA Personal Journey: The connection to mental health wasn't merely professional. It was deeply personal. CEO and Founder Stephanie Bashford's path to recovery included the integration of exercise, and she passionately shared her experiences through the \"Discussing Mental Health\" podcast. The project took a poignant turn during the pandemic when Stephanie lost her younger brother to medication prescribed for his mental health conditions. This heartbreaking event fueled her commitment to helping others who faced similar struggles. Stephanie was determined to make a difference.\n\nA Unique Approach: \"Discussing Mental Health\" is not just another mental health initiative. It's a fresh, unique, and innovative combination of talking therapy and exercise. This approach offers a holistic way to address mental well-being, recognising the undeniable link between physical activity and mental health.\n\nCommunity Impact: The ultimate vision is to make mental health support accessible to as many citizens as possible. \n\nRegistered Company No: 14174609",

  "company_description": "Why did we open a music recording and podcast studio in Maidenhead? My name is Tarun Puri and I am the owner and founder of Sherwood Studios.\n\n\"My passion for music came from being sat in a recording session many years ago, watching my sister perform a demo of one of her songs at the time. The concept of being able to create something from nothing, whilst telling your own story is something special because music can be extremely powerful, in helping you find your own identity which can be hard for young people in todays society. There is a constant pressure to compare yourself with others on social media, which can be harmful in focusing on your own journey and development. Sherwood Studios provides a space, where your artistic growth and peace of mind is our primary concern\". \n\nTarun has been making music for over five years, amassing over four million streams on Spotify alone. Having a strong support network really helped Tarun in building a loyal fan base. This is something that Sherwood Studios wants to emphasise, birthing its very own creative community in Maidenhead. In fact, there is a lot of talent in Maidenhead and its surrounding areas that is ready to be developed and elevated. That's why the team had such an appetite to open a studio in Maidenhead. Tarun's music has given him the platform to work alongside a number of different charities, such as Young Minds, Child Bereavement UK and Cardiac Risk in the Young. From this, they raised over £5000 in the process. Sherwood Studios believes that music and video production should always tell a story. We are dedicated to telling your story.\n\nWe feel blessed to be able to work with such talented creatives in the music and podcast space, as we feel part of their journey. It's very important to us that we create an experience and a product that is bespoke, tailored to each individual and their specific requirements. \n\nThe team is now constantly growing & we can't wait to see what the future holds for us.",
