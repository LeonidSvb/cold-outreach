They have been featured in top-tier publications such as Vogue, Bazaar, and The New York Times and published three books sharing their styling process and philosophies. Heralded as a leader in the field of Luxury Lifestyle Consulting, their unique 5 Step approach to identifying and nurturing one's individual ‘style type' begins in the wardrobe, transforming lives and empowering through style.\n\nIn distinction to other style consultants and trend experts, Visual Therapy excavates and enhances the client's already unique style personality in the belief that true and lasting style is an outward expression of an inner state. Merging fashion, psychology and spirit, the Visual Therapy method brings clarity to the closet, enabling people to form a concise and confident coordination of their external image and internal identity.\n\n\nOUR SERVICES:\n\nWe call it Visual Therapy because it's an intimate experience for an individual to open their life and closet, sharing any challenges knowing they will be guided with compassion.\n\nWe collaborate with our clients to define and enhance their own unique style. We translate trends to reality and ensure our clients feel current, appropriate and most importantly, like themselves. The unification of who they are inside and the image they wish to portray allows them to take their personal style to the next level. We line up optimal looks for every category of their lives making getting dressed effortless and enjoyable.\n\nVisual Therapy inspires clients to live a healthier, more balanced lifestyle, revealing the best version of themselves not only in personal style and home, but in all areas of life.",

We offer motivational speaking and training in a variety of areas including customer service, communication, leadership, and dealing with change.\n\nTwo of our most popular programs:\n\nMotivation by Chocolate\n\nThis session features two things everyone likes – chocolate and motivation!  It teaches nine key motivational concepts that can help participants get more out of every day – both personally and professionally.  They'll learn about persistence, passion, effective allocation of resources, the law of diminishing returns, and much more!  The session includes a chocolate tasting to demonstrate not only how to appreciate chocolate, but life itself.  \n\nHow to Communicate with Everyone Who is Not You\n\nLife would be so easy if everyone we interacted with was just like us. They would understand our cryptic e-mail messages, forgive our bizarre text messages, and understand why we unfriended them on Facebook. There would be no hard feelings, no conflict, and clearly, world peace. Unfortunately, no one else is exactly like you and to succeed in life and business, you have to work with the frustrating, the angry, the silly, and yes, even the smarter and more articulate. This session will help you do just that. You will learn about barriers to communication and how to remove them. You'll get tips on defusing hostile people (especially helpful for those in customer service or divorce court). You'll take a communication styles quiz and find out just how different a large portion of the world really is and how to get along with them. There will be tips on technology and how to be more effective when using it to communicate. And you'll even improve your listening skills (not that anyone has better ideas than you, but they might have more information). People won't stop being different, but this session will help you understand them.",

She is also the author of the book \"Transformative Conversations: The heart of the leadership journey.\"​\n\nLeaders spend at least 75% of their time communicating, yet, half of all leaders have poor dialogue skills, costing their companies millions of dollars annually. Furthemore, according to the 2018 Global Communications Report. PR professionals believe that in the next 5 years 6 of the top 10 skills most needed for organizational success have to do with communication of some kind.  \n\nEven the most talented leaders can benefit from developing sharp leadership communication skills that would allow them to reach their audiences. Increasing emotional and rational connections will facilitate addressing the issues that need to be tackled. Being a sharp communicator is not the same as being a great talker or a great orator but it's more like being a great conversationalist and communicator.\n\nWorking with Dr. Ada people learn to create conversations that inspire imagination, collaboration and innovative action for positive change.

  "company_description": "Specialized Educational Experiences is an organization devoted to driving improved healthcare outcomes through the development of allied health courses, treatment tools and patient educational materials.\n\n        I know about the pain you feel and the stress you are under. Through the years, I have recovered from migraines, sacroiliac pain, lumbar pain, thoracic pain, neck pain, knee pain and nerve pain in my arms and legs. I've broken numerous bones. I have had severe food allergies, insomnia, and sleep apnea. I have made it through liver disease, gallbladder disease and irritable bowel syndrome. Doing so has forced me to personally deal with a veritable spectrum of physical pain. Aside from dealing with my own issues, I have devoted the better part of my life to improving others' quality of life.\n\n        For the past 39 years, I have been a Physical Therapist at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, where I get to \"pick the brains\" of some incredible physicians and scientists. For the past 34 years, I have taught physical therapy courses throughout the country with a very gifted group of therapists. Daily, I care for patients of every diagnosis, but my focus is the rehabilitation of people who have not yet been able to control and/or resolve their pain.\n\n       Through the summation of my life events and experiences, including all the people I've been able to help, I am convinced of three fundamental truths: (1) the power to overcome a challenge lies in your determination to do so; (2) your success lies in clearly understanding all the variables; and (3) without an organized, well executed and dynamic battle plan, your chances of success rapidly declines.\n\n       Please join me in an exploration of your pain experience, the reasons why your pain hasn't stopped and about developing a winning battle plan to take back your life.  You have the potential to live a very different life.  Let our collection of books and booklets show you the way.",

However, the process of actually owning a small business means wearing many different hats; and most of your training for those positions is of the on-the-job variety.\n\nWhile you know your business best, sometimes having a helping hand to smooth out the wrinkles in your writing by proofreading your marketing materials, your website, your new brochure, your menu or your catalog can make the difference between being in the game and winning it.\n\nOr maybe writing isn't one of your strengths, and, on the advice of many savvy business professionals, you're working to do what you're good at and hire others to handle those aspects of the business that you're … less successful … with.\n\nEither way, I can help.\n\nI am a professional writer and editor. Words are MY passion. I eat, breathe and live them. I am an editor for several business to business magazines in NYC and have my masters in publishing from Pace University; which means that I have both the training and experience to take you to the next step.\n\nToday, I work with individuals and small businesses helping them put what they are passionate about into words. Whether you're interested in having someone proofread your website or write a form letter to help you attract new clients, send me an email at mbreau@jargonwriter.com or call me at (347) 989-2488 today.\n\nI offer every potential customer a free half hour consultation–we'll talk about your business and discuss what's important to you. We'll figure out how we can work together, and how I can help grow your business. Even if you decide not to hire me, the half an hour is free–and you're welcome to use any ideas we come up with together for marketing your business.",

It is not for folks looking for a quick fix, magic potion, elixir, or system to gain blink-of-an-eye results as a substitute for consistently showing up and working ON your business. ON is different than IN. In is providing therapy, writing notes, submitting claims and collaborating with providers for your client's care. We already know you are a pro at that. ON is about creating policies, procedures, plans and systems AND implementing them to ensure your practice becomes profitable and stays that way for years to come.",
