Content marketing is the best way to build a profitable business because it generates low-cost clicks and high-margin customers. We built our company with it, and we've helped thousands of others do the same.\n\n2. It's also one of the best ways for a person to build a happy life. That might sound a bit corny to you, but it's true. When you show the world who you are at scale, you attract incredible opportunities on autopilot.\n\n3. Being a content creator isn't enough. That'll get you a lot of likes, followers, and search clicks, but it won't pay your bills. Instead, you need to be a Copy Creator who generates tons of attention and profit.\n\n4. The vast majority of marketing blogs and gurus give you way too little and charge you way too much. We give you course-quality information for free and paid offers that are legitimately game-changing.\n\nIf those resonate with you, join our newsletter.",

(Food And Travel) experiences through her blog.  \n\nHer personal brand of over 100,000 followers has been awarded Best Hope Food Influencer at the International Influencer Awards of Monaco and recognized by a variety of outlets like Bloomberg and Cosmpolitan. This success has led to hundreds of brand partnerships, her own online cooking series with \"In the Know\", and continued social media engagement and growth. Caitlin has since expanded to build a business that helps individuals and organizations build their brands through meaningful digital content, community and connection. She is an expert digital storyteller and social media strategist — creating both visual, verbal and written content for various clients throughout the food and hospitality industry. Some past and present clients include Adobe, BeachBound, Don Angie, Explore Kissaki, Jollibee, Marriott, Norweigan Cruise Line, Resorts World, SPAM, Visit Finland, Visit Laguna Beach, and VIsit Portugal. Her work spans from garnering a million impressions on social media through a sponsored culinary & culture trip in Israel to helping drive $2 million+ in DTC sales through content marketing for Momofuku Goods, the hospitality group's new line of business with restaurant-grade pantry essentials. \n\nCaitlin is also a builder of genuine community — she has not only built her own audience and following, she helps other businesses create loyal and engaged communities. Her focused tactics include nurturing influencer relationships for brand awareness, hosting impact-driven influencer and community events, carving out distinct spaces for VIP communities to connect and receive lifetime value, creating social dialogue and trendspotting.",

  "company_description": "Neal Schaffer created his social media strategy consultancy Windmills Marketing DBA NealSchaffer.com and PDCA Social to fill a gap that brands and companies have between their willingness to effectively implement social media throughout their organization and their ability to do so. Neal believed the answer to this problem is two-fold: 1) Many companies simply lacked the experience of working deeply with social media platforms and/or were not maximizing the full functionality they provided and 2) Companies lack a strategy and structure for which to govern the everyday activities of their social efforts and tie it in with the ROI for whatever strategic corporate objective they have. Neal, therefore, created a unique and completely proprietary social media strategy consulting program which, combined with his social media coaching and training, has helped dozens of companies better leverage and strategically utilize social media for a variety of objectives, including marketing, sales, business development, customer service, reputation management, and crisis management. The proprietary framework and process used to develop a social media strategy forms the basis of Neal's book Maximize Your Social.\n\nNeal's firm provides the following social media consulting services:\n\nSocial Media Strategy Consulting\n\nSocial Media Coaching\n\nSocial Media Training and Workshops",

And the new approach worked.\n\nWith each campaign Michael implemented, measured and evolved the approach, applying traditional marketing principles and strategies to the world of SEO. After getting consistently exceptional results for local, national and international clients in a variety of industries, it became clear. Online advertising in the hands of a creative marketing mind was far superior to the standard SEO strategies that solely targeted search results.\n\nThis evolution of traditional and modern marketing is now the basis of SearchRPM.",

One aspect of that was through moving to a low carb lifestyle, which has resulted in me losing over 70 lbs and getting off of blood pressure medication for the first time in two decades.  I also tapped into my passion for training and cooking to create SeriousKeto.\n\nSince then, SeriousKeto has become one of the top 1/2 of 1% of ALL YouTube channels and has over 200K social media subscribers/followers.  On any given day, my content is viewed by 20K to 30K individuals, as I share recipes, motivation and inspiration to people who want to take control of their health naturally.\n\nIt's been so rewarding to get comments, messages and emails daily from my followers, thanking me for helping them lose weight, conquer diabetes, eliminate inflammation, and get off of prescription medications.  I also get the opportunity to fight the immense amounts of misinformation propagated by the media, big food, and big pharma about the many health benefits of a low carb lifestyle.",

After numerous NHL events and literally hundreds of blog articles Inside Edge Hockey News started doing podcasts.  As the years went on the blog articles were taken over by podcasts.  In 2021, Inside Edge Hockey News became Inside Edge Hockey Media Group.  A National Hockey League media company.  Featuring a professional hockey podcast centered around the Calgary Flames. Flames Unfiltered is entering its sixth season.  The latest venture is a hockey podcast network called Talkin Hockey. It is currently in the works and will feature hockey podcast all in one spot, a hockey podcaster networking site and a 24/7 hockey radio channel.   The Inside Edge Hockey Media Group is a credentialed National Hockey League media member.",

Employees want to work for a company that is having a positive impact. Employees expect the companies they work for to do more. Consumers expect companies to take a stand on issues that are close to their hearts. There is a huge opportunity available for companies to support non-profits & help solve social issues. \n\nSo how can your company \"do good\" at a time where there is so much virtue-signaling, cause-washing & green-washing? \n\nWhether it's a moment or a movement, it has to have real impact. It's not just performative. It's about the action taken that goes along with the messaging. \n\nSteph Belsky & Alana Ficalora are shining a light on campaigns & events that missed an opportunity for maximum social impact, often leaving money on the table, as well as highlighting those that are doing it right. \n\nOur monthly virtual series in now a podcast.

Over time, the profitability of innovative companies was 35% to 80% better than non-innovative companies. \n\nOur starting point is that all employees are capable of high degrees of creativity, and that the organization restricts that creativity due its culture. Hiring more creative people or acquiring companies with innovative products or services is not as effective as increasing the level of creativity with the existing employees to their potential. The process includes the creation of creativity-supportive environment, individual creativity training, team and team leader processes, and finally effective implementation mechanism to turn creative ideas into innovative products, services, and processes.",

We secure long term, agency financing to position the asset for success in any market cycle.\n\nWe bring in a professional management team to stabilize the property. We utilize a proven framework and industry leading, best practices to fill vacancies and appreciate rents to market demand. We will implement RUBS, change the fee structure, add storage units, dog parks, or other tested strategies to drive up profit and reduce costs.\n\nOur goal is to create generational wealth for you and your families. As such we will choose the most appropriate exit strategy that is in line with this goal. This may include selling the property within 3-10 years, holding the property for longer, and/or utilizing the refi and roll strategy with a cash out refinance.",
