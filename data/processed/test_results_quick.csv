I'm recommending AC Comfort to my family and freinds. Google Pete O, This month Great service, knowledgeable, and always so nice and friendly! My chiropractor recommended them a couple years ago and I'm so glad he did, I've been using them ever since! After I had to replace my HVAC system, they even had cookies delivered to me as a thank you! Yeah, most expensive free cookies I've ever had, but still, super kind and very appreciated! Google Dave Wimpenny, This month Great customer service on time..thorough check all good Google morgabp, This month Great service Google Joshua Holt, Last month Jose H. did a great job on my inspection and dehumidifier repair. He and his team conducted long overdue HVAC maintenance that was neglected by the previous homeowner. Glad we chose AC Comfort! Google Karen Womack, Last month I wanted to share with all interested parties looking for an excellent team of AC Repair folks. AC Comfort Supply has been servicing my older unit for over 3 years. They are the most dedicated and honest people I've ever had the pleasure of working with. They provide courteous, prompt service with photographs to back up everything they tell you. The same technician comes to my home every year, so we have a history of information we work with to keep my unit up and running. I'm on a service plan, which means they come 3 times a year to check my unit for any parts that might be failing or struggling, and offer suggestions as to what would keep my unit running effeciently, but never any pressure sales. My technician's name is Osiel, Osie for short. He is the most polite and knowledgeable persons I've ever used. He really knows his stuff~! Thanks Osie for all your dedication and work for me. Google Diego ""Deo"" Uzcategui, Last month Service was professional and quick. The technician educated us on what the issue was and how to prevent it in the future. Also gave us suggestions on how to making our system more efficient. I highly recommend them for all your AC needs. 10/10 Google Tripletplayz, Last month I've been using AC Comfort since 2014, and it's been amazing to watch their growth — a true reflection of the excellent customer service and quality work they provide. They once went above and beyond by responding to an emergency at a post-funeral gathering for my family, fixing the issue right away and even following up days later with a condolence gift. That level of care is rare. I highly recommend AC Comfort to anyone looking for reliable, compassionate, and professional service. Google Brandon Scott, Last month Rey and his team are always forthright and provide a very detailed analysis of your systems. We rely on them for all of HVAC maintenance and repairs. Highly recommended! Google Sharon Ugalde, Last month AC Comfort did a great job servicing my AC.They came on time and informed me what they were doing and any potential work I might need.

We recommend having your air conditioner examined at least once a year. A yearly air conditioner maintenance service can aid in detecting and preventing any internal issues. Get in touch with our experts for regular air conditioner servicing. Q2. How to Maintain your Air Conditioner after Repair? A. Clean or replace your air conditioning system’s filter every month or two. As when dirt builds upon it, it blocks the airflow. Getting a good vacuum and cleaning service each month can help you. Ask the Chill Brother Technician about maintaining and how often next servicing is required. Q3. Why is repair important when my furnace makes weird noises? All furnaces are supposed to make some noise and that’s completely fine. However, loud banging, rattling, or squealing sounds coming from your furnace is a warning sign. Mechanical issues, loose parts, or airflow problems cause these weird noises. You should get your furnace fixed as soon as possible when you hear these sounds. Because mechanical issues and loose parts will worsen the problem as time goes on. Other problems will follow if unattended, and possibly a breakdown. Problems with the airflow will make your indoor air quality poorer. Q4. Why Choose The Chill Brothers for your home? A. The Chill Brothers are a Houston-based air conditioning company.

I will be calling to have ABC Air do the repair. Google Reviews V Virginia Long time standing customer. This business has very knowledgeable techs & great customer service. Google Reviews P Philip Morin Jr. Dependable service and experience Google Reviews K Ken Taylor Very professional. The owner came out and had me back up and running quickly. Will use them for any other issues in future Google Reviews A Aaron Giles Second time using ABCs services. This time was at 745pm. Steve answered his phone within a few rings. Said he could make it if I wanted. He arrived on time. Had the issue solved in 30-50 min. My renter was able to sleep cool and was happy. As a landlord I highly recommend ABC cooling, specifically Steve. If I should need AC help at my other properties, Steve will be my first call.

Our Reviews Slide title The technician, Wes, arrived and immediately got busy checking out our system. He was very thorough and shared a lot of information with me. I would highly recommend Env Air. - rickwt64 Button Slide title I just get a very honest feeling about them. They fixed my heat pump (AquaCal pool chiller/heater) in a half hour. Same heat pump that a previous repair person said needed to be completely replaced or fixed for $1,800. Easy to contact, schedule, showed up right on time, good service and follow-up after the call. I wouldn't hesitate to give them a try. - Bill T. Button Slide title One of the best prices we found. Fast and courteous. - Ryan G. Button Slide title I have been using Environmental Air for about 18 months now and have been extremely pleased with both their service and their employees. I have a twice yearly contract for both my house and a condo and they arrive on time, service is timely and the technicians are always polite and helpful. I'd especially like to give a 'shout out' to John - he not only drove 30 minutes out of his way (I mistakenly sent him to the wrong address), he arrived cheerful and handled the job quickly. He also repaired my door lock that was not working properly. A man of all trades! Really appreciate his attitude and professionalism. This is why my husband and I will continue with Environmental Air. - Jerel S. Button Slide title They worked with us to provide a system that met our needs on the schedule we needed.

Our Latest Article... Your HVAC System Can Enhance Sleep December 9, 2021 The sound of a well-maintained heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system is like a lullaby for a good night’s sleep. If odd sounds, such as banging, squealing, or rattling, from your HVAC system are keeping you up at night, it is time to schedule maintenance and regain a peaceful nighttime environment in your Texas home. Let our qualified technicians at A-Plus Mechanical Services inspect, clean, and, if necessary, repair your heating and cooling system. Your HVAC equipment will operate at peak efficiency and with minimal sound after a tune-up. You will notice the enhanced comfort and improved bedtime atmosphere in your Houston home. Sleep Helps Maintain Health Although the U.S Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends adults sleep seven or more hours per night, one in three adults say they log fewer hours. Insufficient sleep is related to the development of heart disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other chronic conditions. It can affect mental agility and energy level and lead to accidents resulting in injury and possibly death. What Causes Sleepless Nights? Some adults seek professional medical help for sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome and sleep apnea, that prevent them from getting quality sleep. Lifestyle and environmental conditions also may cause restless and interrupted sleep. Sleep experts recommend that you stop using electronics, such as cell phones, television, and computers, at least a half-hour before bedtime. Skip the alcoholic or caffeinated beverages when you are preparing for sleep and maintain a consistent bedtime schedule. Set your alarm clock for the same time each morning. Too Hot or Cold You will sleep better if you feel comfortable. Keep your bedroom dark and slightly cool at night. Try keeping the temperature from 60 to 67 degrees Fahrenheit. Because a lower body temperature makes you sleepy, dropping the temperature at bedtime can help to promote sleep. Consider installing a programmable or smart thermostat to maintain precise temperature control in your Houston home. After you program your comfort preferences, the device will change the temperature for you at night and then increase it in the morning. Controlling Humidity The amount of moisture in your living space also affects the quality of your sleep. A-Plus Mechanical Services can assess your indoor air quality (IAQ) and recommend a solution to control humidity. If you have too much moisture in the air, your bedroom may feel stuffy, making it hard to breathe and fall asleep. A high humidity level in your home can encourage the growth of mold and dust mites, which in turn triggers allergies, respiratory issues, and asthma symptoms. Itchy eyes, sinus problems, and allergies can interfere with quality sleep. Humidity is at an ideal level between 35 to 50 percent. If it consistently drops below the minimum percent, it will result in dry air that can cause dry skin, chapped lips, and irritated nasal passages. A-Plus Mechanical Services can recommend a whole-house dehumidifier to reduce the amount of water vapor in your home’s atmosphere. Or we can suggest a whole-house humidifier to add moisture if the humidity is too low. These comfort systems integrate into your heating and cooling equipment to improve the air throughout your home. Schedule your free consultation today. Improve Air Quality Improve indoor air quality by having your HVAC system’s ductwork cleaned. Change your furnace filter every three months during the heating season, and consider installing an air filtration system to work in conjunction with your heating and cooling system. You will breathe easier at night. Regularly cleaning your bedroom will remove dust, pet dander, and other contaminants that can interfere with your comfort at bedtime. Polluted indoor air can cause health problems, including sore throats and congestion, and can interfere with your sleep. Make Quality Sleep a Priority Get a good night’s sleep by controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality with the help of your HVAC system.

The reason is simple. They provide exemplary service! I fully recommend them Emilio Palazuelos I had a unique problem with one of my new units. After several visits, and contacting the manufacturer of the unit, Diamond Blue successfully traced down the issue, and repaired it, at no charge to me. They could easily have charged me labor for the trips they made, but they did not. In my opinion, this is tremendous customer service and sorely missed in our current environment. Susan Heath I have used Diamond Blue for several years for my A/C service and maintenance. They are quick to come to our house when we call. The service is always thorough and complete.

Featured Manufacturer Our Happy Clients Says TG Johnson      “ We used them last year for a new Trane and they were great. They did an excellent job protecting our home and the AC works great. Today we called for a service call on an older Trane and they sent a 20 year employee. He got us back up and running for a very reasonable service call. These guys are trustworthy and the kind of people you want working on you home. ” Christopher Vogel      Alief Ultra did a fantastic job in a compressed time frame replacing our old damaged HVAC ducts and mixing box with a brand new up to code duct system. Professional and friendly, they were able to explain each step as they progressed through the removal and installation process. They cleaned the return air box and resealed it as a final touch to protect the intake system. Terrific job. I will be contacting them again when we begin investigating installation of a new system.

Jeremy patiently answers my questions and looks out for my best interests. Service: A/C system maintenance M Wilson      Every house we have ever owned in the Houston area, we have had Alief/Ultra maintain and service our heating and air conditioning. We have been a loyal customer for over 15 years and John has been so easy to work with. He is very knowledgeable and has saved us a few times when we had urgent issues. Also, I would highly recommend the service plan program as it has been a great value to us and has assured that our heating and AC systems are always tuned and ready. Thomas Temple      These folks gave us great service at a very reasonable price. Our AC had stopped working and two other companies looked at it and wanted to sell us on a total replacement for 5,000 to 6,000 dollars without finding (or at least telling us) what the problem was. It took Mike about 20 minutes to find a leak in our outside coil and we had it replaced for $1,650. We are retirees on Social Security and couldn't afford a total system replacement. The whole experience with the owner, Mike, the office manager, Anne, and the technicians, Ron and Sam, was positive and I recommend Alief Heating & Air Conditioning without reservation.",4223.0,

So, why should you turn to Efficient Home Solutions? Our main goal is to make you as comfortable as possible, at a price that’s as affordable as possible. We’re passionate about delivering the highest quality services with every job we perform, whether that’s a minor repair or a complete system replacement. While some heating and cooling companies in Plano TX just go through the motions, the experts with Efficient Home Solutions will always be committed to delivering total customer satisfaction. Helping You Save Money While Staying Comfortable There are many Plano heating and cooling companies that are only concerned with making as much money as they possibly can. But at Efficient Home Solutions, we’re more interested in creating long-term relationships with the people we serve. Sure, we want to make a profit like any other business. But we also want to help you save money. Most of your utility bill – and as much as 70 percent of your entire home’s energy consumption –can come from using your heating and cooling system. Even if you have an older system, we can provide you with recommendations that could help you save as much as half of your energy bill – while ensuring you stay comfortable regardless of the outside temperature. There aren’t a lot of heating and cooling companies in Plano TX that will do the same thing.

I contacted several AC/HVAC service providers, and ME Brown stood out as one of the most reasonably priced. What truly set them apart, however, was their knowledge of the product. When I spoke with David, I learned that there were different REME HALO models available—something other providers hadn’t even mentioned. His expertise gave me the confidence that I was making an informed decision. The installation, carried out by Joni, was quick and highly professional. It’s clear that ME Brown stands behind both their products and their workmanship. Almost immediately after the REME HALO was installed, I noticed a difference in the air quality and smell in our home. It’s been especially effective at eliminating strong odors—everything from fried onions to burnt food. Being new to Houston, TX, we had assumed that the mildew smell in bath towels after just one use was normal. However, since the purifier was installed, that smell has disappeared completely—even after multiple uses. This truly proves that the entire home is benefiting from cleaner, treated air every time the system runs. I would highly recommend ME Brown for all your AC/HVAC and Air Purification needs. Their professionalism, product knowledge, and service quality are outstanding.” - Preston K. Air Conditioner|Gas Furnace Installation in Bellaire, TX 77401 October 25, 2024 “I have been a customer for over 15 years and I want to say how nice this company is. The service is outstanding and the crew are professional. The installed a new system in our home over 15 yrs ago and did all the maintenance since. They have always been on time and professional. Recently there were problems with our duct work as it was original ridgid ducting. Wes and David handled the problem and replaced all ducting, air handler as well as a new coil. I couln't ask for better or quicker service. There work was neat and orderly and they finished the job ahead of schedule.

Once Billy got here, he took his time explaining stuff and was very patient, as I was a bit nervous it was going to be very expensive. I am a new homeowner, so I really appreciated the time Billy took to explain what was wrong and my different options. He also took the time to show me how to change my filters in the future. I did not feel rushed and did not feel like I was trying to be upsold. Thanks 5 stars and Billy High!! Dawn M Garland, TX I recently reached out to 5 STAR HVAC for an estimate/quote to install a new 4-ton furnace for my 2 story home.

In a HOT city like Houston you can’t survive without air conditioning! I found them on Yelp less than 24 hours after Harvey destroyed my AC systems at my old house. Same as today, they fixed it that same day!!! They’ve never been mysterious about what’s gone wrong during maintenance visits. They’ve always been prompt and on time and they have 24 hour service by the owner. He answers the phone himself on Sunday evenings if I’ve needed it. I simply would never trust anyone else! My family and I have been devoted customers since Harvey.” – A.U. Very Professional “James Richmond was very professional in all areas. He came out in the middle of the winterstorm and hard freeze in Houston to repair our malfunctioning heating system. He explained the issue and fixed it. I truly thank this company for taking care of us and definitely will recommend James and his company.” – C.P. Surpassed My Expectations “I’ve had to use Richmond’s twice in the last year, for my AC unit breaking down and for issues with my furnace during the Texas Freeze. Both times they have surpassed my expectations. Richmond’s has responded quickly and came to check out the issues within 24 hours (within the hour with the furnace issue!). Both times accurately identified and fixed the issue seamlessly. They have become my go to for HVAC issues and maintenance. Highly recommend and will use them in the future!

He fixed my AC unit in about half an hour and was so kind the entire time. Their service was so good, I signed up the maintenance plan today as well. Such a great company and so glad they are on our list!!"" - Kelly Diaz ""I highly recommend! They are always so kind and professional! They go above and beyond to make sure everything is fixed and give great recommendations to prevent any future problems they might see! They even picked up little bits that accidentally went on the floor by our front door. I’m not even sure it was from them, but they knew I had a toddler and were worried he would put it in his mouth just in case! So sweet! I can’t recommend them enough! They are amazing!"" - Holly Johnston ""Had a great experience with Dylan servicing my HVAC system that a previous company had put a band aid on when it needed to be replaced. He even spoke on the phone with my developer and let him know what the warranty servicers had done wrong.

Frequently Asked Questions What Are Common HVAC Issues in Richardson? In Richardson, the wide range of temperatures can put a strain on HVAC systems. Common issues include inefficient heating during winter and cooling problems in the sweltering summers. Systems might freeze over, blow lukewarm air, or show signs of wear due to increased usage. Regular maintenance, such as checking refrigerant levels and cleaning filters, can mitigate most of these issues. At AC Pros, we offer detailed system checks to ensure everything is working correctly to avoid these common problems. How Can I Improve My HVAC System's Efficiency? Maintaining the efficiency of your HVAC system is vital, especially with Richardson's fluctuating weather. Some effective strategies include sealing duct leaks, upgrading to a programmable thermostat, and performing regular maintenance checks. Additionally, ensuring your home is well-insulated can help reduce the strain on your HVAC system. At AC Pros, we provide tailored advice and maintenance services to optimize your system's performance. What Should I Look for in an HVAC Contractor? Choosing an HVAC contractor can be challenging. Look for a contractor with a proven track record, proper licensing, and insurance. It's also important to choose a company that has solid reviews, offers transparent pricing, and provides warranties on their work. At AC Pros, we pride ourselves on our customer satisfaction and high standards of service, ensuring that you get the best in the industry. When Should I Replace My HVAC System? If your HVAC system is over 15 years old, frequently breaks down, or causes your energy bills to skyrocket, it might be time for a replacement. Newer models are much more efficient and can save money in the long run. At AC Pros, we help evaluate your current system and assist in selecting a new, energy-efficient model that fits your needs and budget. What Can I Do to Prepare for the Installation Day? To ensure a smooth installation process, clear the area around your existing HVAC system and any pathways the installers will use. Make arrangements to keep pets and small children away from the work area. At AC Pros, we also recommend reviewing the installation plan with our team in advance to address any concerns you may have. This preparation helps the process proceed efficiently and safely. Get started by calling us at (972) 736-8864 or complete our online form to request a free estimate.

Precision Matters: Why Proper System Design Is Essential An HVAC system is more than just an appliance—it’s a vital part of the overall comfort and efficiency of your home. Improperly sizing or installing a system without considering the specific needs of your home can lead to long-term problems, including: Oversized Systems: It may seem like a larger system would provide better cooling, but an oversized unit often causes more harm than good. It leads to higher upfront costs, increased monthly energy bills, inefficient humidity control, inconsistent temperature regulation, and excessive noise. Undersized Systems: A unit that is too small will struggle to keep up with demand, running continuously and driving up energy costs. It may fail to properly cool or dehumidify the home, resulting in poor airflow, uneven temperatures, and excessive wear and tear that shortens the system’s operational life. Many homeowners unknowingly suffer from inefficient systems that were not designed with the specifications of their homes in mind. At Cool Master, we take a scientific and data-driven approach to residential air conditioning and heating for homes in Houston, ensuring every installation is correctly sized and optimized for maximum efficiency and comfort.

Service Details NEW SYSTEM: : For an aged system that has deteriorated and is running high maintenance and utility bills, replacement becomes the more viable solution.

For Cypress homes, we recommend scheduling professional maintenance twice a year—once in spring before the intense cooling season, and once in fall before the heating season. This schedule ensures your system is prepared for Cypress's temperature extremes and helps prevent costly emergency repairs. What are signs that my AC needs repair in Cypress? In Cypress's hot climate, warning signs include uneven cooling, unusual noises, strange odors, or sudden increases in energy bills. Poor airflow, frequent cycling, or water leaks around your unit also indicate your system needs professional attention before the problem worsens in Cypress's heat. How can I improve my HVAC system's energy efficiency in Cypress? For Cypress homes, regular maintenance is key—including cleaning or replacing filters monthly during peak usage, sealing ductwork leaks, ensuring proper insulation, and installing a programmable thermostat. For maximum savings in Cypress's climate, consider upgrading to a high-efficiency HVAC system with a SEER rating of 16 or higher. What should I do if my AC won't turn on during a Cypress summer? First, check your thermostat settings and ensure the unit has power. Check your circuit breaker and make sure the outdoor disconnect switch is on. If these basic checks don't resolve the issue, contact our Cypress HVAC professionals immediately for a thorough diagnosis and repair before temperatures rise further. How long does an HVAC system typically last in Cypress's climate? With proper maintenance, an HVAC system can last 15-20 years in Cypress. However, our local climate's demands, frequency of use, maintenance consistency, and installation quality can affect this timeline. Regular professional maintenance from our Cypress HVAC experts can significantly extend your system's service life. Don't let HVAC issues disrupt your comfort in Cypress.

As your equipment gets older, its efficiency can decrease dramatically. You may notice that it gets noisier and needs repairs more often. When a unit begins to show its age, you have two choices. You can overhaul the system or replace it. Because heating and cooling technologies improve over time, a new system designed with newer, more energy-efficient equipment makes sense, especially if your system is 10 or more years old. We can estimate the cost of a new system as well as a payback schedule that will show you how newer technology will pay you back in lower energy usage. Can I just replace the outdoor unit on an older system to save money? No. Replacing only the outdoor unit will lower the efficiency of the unit. In fact, you can lose up to 15% of the unit’s efficiency! You should always replace the indoor cooling coil with the outdoor unit. We would prefer that if you replace the outdoor unit, you should replace you indoor cooling coil as well. Will a bigger sized system perform better? No. you don’t want your air conditioner to be too big. Air conditioners control the comfort level in your home by cooling the air and by removing humidity. An oversized air conditioner will cool your home faster, but it will use more energy and will not remove humidity adequately. A unit that is too big for your home will have short run cycles. It may take only a short time to cool the air, but the unit shuts off before enough air blows across the indoor coil where moisture condenses into water and drains from your system. Too much moisture left in the air can lead to mold and mildew problems. These short run cycles also mean your system starts and stops more often, which uses more energy and causes a lot of wear and tear. An air conditioner operates more efficiently during long run cycles. The same holds true with heating systems. An oversized furnace will warm the house quicker, but it uses more fuel and causes greater temperature swings in the home.

We install American Standard, Lennox, Trane, and Goodman systems sized specifically for your home's cooling load.

We service gas furnaces, heat pumps, and electric heating systems during cold snaps. Most heating calls happen during the coldest weeks when equipment that sat unused suddenly doesn't work.

We check gas connections, test safety controls, clean burners, and verify proper airflow.

Water Filtration & Treatment Dallas Dallas area water quality varies by neighborhood. Many families choose filtration systems for better taste and health benefits. We install reverse osmosis systems, whole-house filters, and water softeners that address specific local water issues. Hard water minerals damage water heaters, dishwashers, and washing machines. White buildup on faucets comes from mineral deposits. Hard water affects how soap lathers and can dry out skin and hair. Water softeners remove these minerals and extend the life of your plumbing fixtures and appliances. Filtration systems remove chlorine taste and odor while improving drinking water quality.

Call (214) 823-9958 Happy MB Kiser customer since 2014. Great company, very dependable and always on time. My A/C bit the dust on Monday, and they sent a tech to fix it right away. A broken A/C in Texas during summer time is as good as a death sentence lol. Luckily these guys are always around. Thank you the MB Kiser team and Jordan in particular. Big thanks to Kristen for expediting the part ordering. Oleg M. OVERALL EXPERIENCE WAS 100% POSITIVE. Kathleen M. Well we used them twice and both times were happy with the price and work that was done. Susan M. They are great. Our downstairs unit went out. They were able to put in the model I wanted. It was a 5 ton horizontal system, and a difficult installation. They had the resources to get it done. They ran into some problems but they charged us what the original bid was. They were also able to fix the upstairs air conditioning. They are very professional and always respectful. They were able to troubleshoot as they went along. If there were any problems, they were able to fix them. Anna A. Thank you so much for your consideration. I truly appreciate your service to keep my aged system working. Vincent F. I have now used MB Kiser for about 12 years. They have always been fast and honest. Recently, I had my AC go out at my office they fixed it fast with a $35 capacitor. The repair person I had out before Kiser tried to sell me an entire hvac system. Kiser also repaired one of my home units at 8pm on a hot evening fast and easy. Much to my amazement they did not even charge for emergency or afterhours. M.B. Kiser is wonderful to work with. K. B. We had our second HVAC system installed by M.B. Kiser today. They are excellent. The installation team arrived at 8:30 and left at 6 with all the work complete, area cleaned up and a great Carrier Infinity system installed. We have two systems in our house. We had the same setup installed last year and it has been flawless. The prices are competitive and the installers and service people are professional, competent and excellent communicators. Highly recommend. John P. Annual maintenance plan is pretty straightforward and a much better value than paying twice a year for the same service at twice the rate. Service manager came out after the first call didn’t fix it, and made sure the unit cooled. Awesome service and friendly people. Daniel M. I have used MB Kiser three times now at two different properties. Kenny and John are the best techs I have come across. This is a company that really puts their customers first which probably explains why they have been around so long. David W. Living in Texas we learn to appreciate our Air conditioners! I was ready to freak out yesterday when my unit stopped working and I am expecting some family over this weekend for the holidays! I started searching for a reputable air conditioning company in the metroplex. Couple of my friends at work referred me to MB Kiser and I decided to give them a try! I have called their customer service and lady on the phone was very knowledgeable and willing to help, which was a big plus for me. Amy D. THIS COMPANY DOES BOTH COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL WORK. HAD A NEW SYSTEM PUT IN AT THE BARBER SHOP. WORKERS WERE VERY PROFESSIONAL AND THE WORK WAS DONE QUICKLY AND CORRECTLY. ALSO HAD THEM COME AND REPLACE A HEATING UNIT AT HOME. SAME GOOD SERVICE AND PRICE WAS COMPARABLE TO OTHER ESTIMATES THAT I GOT. Rebecca J. We have a service contract with them so they come every six months to prepare the furnace and air conditioner. We get a reduced rate for any repairs because of the contract and we never get charged for any overtime. My parents also use them. I would recommend them. They redid our whole system in our old house. We’ve used them for 45 years. One of the guys remembered coming to our family home when I was little. Elizabeth A. They called ahead of time to let us know they were coming. They were right on time. They checked out our heater. We had just bought the house and couldn’t get the pilot light lit. The tech determined that there was air in the line, so he bled the line and got the pilot light lit. He checked out the heater and told us the heater was fine and didn’t need any more work. Theresa V. Quick response, my AC was out Friday all day and they came out first thing Saturday morning. Jordan answered all my questions, and verified the issue within first 10 minutes. I would highly recommend using them in the future. Saj J.

We have already had several cold nights, and the new furnace is not only much quieter, but heats the house much better too. It’s great to know I will not have to worry about any comfort issues in my house for a long time. I would not hesitate one minute to recommend Chapman Air and Heat to anyone that needs a new furnace or air conditioner.” Bud “ AWESOME JOB! Tell Mr. Chapman what an outstanding job that your crew did replacing our systems. I told Tom about my delicate photo equipment and that the crews need to be careful around it. As soon as the crew showed up, they promptly laid down all the needed drop-cloths for our floors and then asked where the photo equipment was so they could be aware of it. That impressed me—one small detail that was very important to me. Great job guys!!!!! “ Scott P. “ The service was exceptional ! Tom went above & beyond the call! All of the technicians were professional and courteous. Adrian was also very informative in explaining to me what was wrong with the AC and how to cope in the meantime until it was replaced. The technicians who replaced the unit were timely and worked very efficiently . They even helped me to replace my air filter after they completed their installation. Awesome work by all technicians ! I thank each of you!” Sabrena SEE ALL REVIEWS If you are in need of emergency service, please call us for immediate assistance.

Our Special HVAC Services in Houston Air Star Now is a full-service heating , ventilation, and air conditioning company. In addition to regular AC repairs, insulation installation, and other standard HVAC jobs, our technicians also solve special HVAC problems, such as keeping leaves out of your outdoor unit, removing unsightly hoses or pipes that run across the floor, or helping to safeguard your equipment. We understand that the needs of each customer are unique, so we strive to offer customized solutions tailored to their individual requirements. With over a decade of experience, our team is equipped with the skills and knowledge to get the job done right the first time around. Our team can help with the installation of: Ceiling Saver Kit. If your AC unit is in your attic or the upper levels of your property and your drains get clogged, the water collected during the dehumidification process can overflow onto your ceiling. To avoid a costly ceiling repair, our team can install a ceiling saver kit that collects water from leaks. Included in this kit is also a safety switch that can cut your AC off should a clog or overflow incident occur. Condensate Pump. This pump transfers wastewater to the proper drain, and our team can install the pump in an aesthetically pleasing way so that you don’t have pipes and hoses running across the floor. Easy-to-See Thermostats. This thermostat has large, raised numbers to help those with visual impairments, and they also make a clicking sound as you adjust the degree settings of your system. Hard Start Kit. Without a hard start kit, your compressor can become easily strained when it starts up and has to work harder than necessary. This puts additional stress on the air conditioner, ultimately reducing its lifespan without proper assistance. Installing a hard start kit is an easy way to increase efficiency while giving extra support during initial operation, preventing costly repairs or replacements down the line. Kool Kap. Your outdoor HVAC unit is constantly exposed to the elements (i.e., rain, snow, dirt, leaves, debris, etc.). This debris can collect at the bottom of your unit, which is a danger to your system, as it may rust or erode. To keep leaves and debris away from your unit and keep it clean year-round, we can install a Kool Kap, which protects your condenser. Protective Remote Monitoring Devices. To monitor your HVAC system when you aren’t home, our team can help you install monitoring devices and technology. Surge Suppressors & Lightning Arrestors. During the sweltering summer months, utility companies often face a high demand for electrical power, resulting in a reduction of their output—a phenomenon known as a brown-out. Such events can lead to serious, potentially irreparable damage to your household appliances, particularly your air conditioner. These appliances are specifically designed to operate at certain power levels; when these levels are reduced, the appliances are pushed to their limits, causing undue strain. Additionally, the threat of lightning strikes harming or even destroying your electrical appliances is ever-looming. By installing a lightning arrestor within your breaker box, you can safeguard all your appliances with ease. Time Delay Relay. This device helps you avoid burning out your compressor if your system’s settings are changed too often. With a time delay relay, your thermostat won’t adjust or turn on/off until up to five minutes after the last adjustment. Many customers with children who play with their thermostat benefit from this product. Air Star Now has been helping our customers address their HVAC needs since 2011. We offer free estimates and consultations, and we pride ourselves on offering our customers tailored solutions. When working with our professionals, we can evaluate your needs and issues and listen to your concerns to best develop a plan to tackle your HVAC project.

Regular maintenance is crucial to keep your HVAC system running efficiently and prevent unexpected breakdowns. It's generally recommended to schedule professional maintenance at least twice a year—once in the spring before cooling season and once in the fall before heating season. This ensures that your system is ready to handle seasonal temperature changes efficiently. During these visits, technicians can clean components, replace filters, check for wear and tear, and ensure everything is operating safely. Keeping up with maintenance helps prolong the life of your HVAC in Houston. What Are the Benefits of Upgrading to a Programmable Thermostat? Upgrading to a programmable thermostat can offer significant energy and cost savings. By allowing you to set specific times for heating and cooling to adjust based on your schedule, these devices reduce energy consumption. For example, you can program the system to lower energy use when you're not home and ramp up comfort settings just before you return. Over time, this can lower utility bills significantly while maintaining a comfortable indoor climate. As part of an HVAC contractor in Houston maintenance plan, we can show you how to maximize these benefits. Why Is My Air Conditioner Blowing Warm Air? There are several reasons your air conditioner might be blowing warm air. Common issues include low refrigerant levels, which could suggest a leak; a malfunctioning compressor; or an issue with the thermostat settings. Additionally, blocked or dirty filters can also restrict airflow and reduce cooling efficiency. It's best to have a qualified HVAC technician assess the system to diagnose and resolve the specific issue quickly. How Can I Improve Indoor Air Quality in My Home? Improving indoor air quality involves several strategies. Regularly changing HVAC filters is essential to prevent dust and allergen buildup. Installing air purifiers or whole-home ventilation systems can further enhance air quality by removing contaminants and replenishing stale air. Additionally, maintaining a regular cleaning schedule and managing indoor humidity levels can also significantly contribute to healthier indoor air. Consulting with an HVAC company in Houston can provide you with more options tailored to local concerns. What Should I Do If My Heater Isn’t Working? If your heater isn't working, first check the thermostat settings to ensure it's on the heat mode and set to an appropriate temperature. Also, inspect the circuit breaker to see if it has tripped. If these aren't the issues, the problem could involve the furnace's ignition system or a more complex mechanical failure. At this point, it's recommended to contact Air Star Now to ensure a quick and professional assessment and repair. As your dependable AC company in Houston, we are ready to help restore your comfort swiftly.

Tried to make sure we had everything we needed and know how to work everything before he left. Kris was awesome. Thank you so much! The team that came out and troubleshooted my heat pump were so kind and informative. They also wore masks and shoe coverings so I was very comfortable with them being in my home while they got my system working properly. Thank you K&S Heating and Air, for repairing my air conditioner. You have saved a marriage. Chris is our professional technician. I appreciate his experience, knowledge and attention to detail. He was prepared to repair our system today, and knocked it out quick. He also made a few recommendations to improve the airflow throughout the house, and ceiling fan adjustments for more efficiency.

Air Conditioning Replacement and Maintenance Service Near You Ice cream, wildflowers, laid-back dressing, beach trips, butterflies and birds in the air; you name it, everybody loves summer. But this season presents your air conditioner with problems. By forcing the AC to run longer, hot weather clogs the air filters, increasing the external fan’s debris. In turn, the system overworks to cool your house, translating to higher bills. It may also lose its cooling power. The same applies to extreme conditions like hailstones and violent winds. If a tornado occurs, the unit’s exterior could suffer damage when a branch lands on it. Lightning also damages electrical connections. Note that the system’s solid construction doesn’t make it indestructible. You still need a dependable HVAC service provider for minor issues and major repairs. Wherever you are in the city, our dedicated contractors respond quickly to restore your home comfort and optimal AC function. Our services also include commercial buildings. Don’t worry about disrupting your office operations; we’ll be in and out before you know it. Remember, slight malfunctions worsen when ignored. The damage might also extend to other components, increasing the repair costs. You may even need to buy a new unit if the current one fails. Eager to find out more about our furnace and heater repair services in League City ? Call today! Don’t forget about the health risks. If the coolant leaks, it may evaporate into harmful gas, causing headaches, nausea, dizziness, and coughing. If you or other household members have experienced any of these signs, disconnect your unit and seek medical help before contacting us for HVAC services. Ordinarily, operational units get rid of water after condensation. However, faulty ones collect moisture inside, encouraging bacteria formation and other dangerous microorganisms. The AC may blow these germs into your house, resulting in breathing complications. Looking for heater repair services in Houston ? Contact our experts today!

Dooley, MPL40536 C. Teeters, TECL19006 M. Perryman Jr. License # TACLB26717E J. Ferguson, MPL#41024 J.Ferguson, TECL19006 M. Perryman Jr. Frequently Asked Questions Can I save money by using a thermostat with my system? Yes! You can save as much as $180 every year on your utility bills when you use a smart, programmable thermostat that will keep your home comfortable all year. Doing so will also put less wear and tear on the system, since it will only run when needed. How do air ducts function? The air conditioning, heating, and ventilation equipment at your workplace or home moves conditioned air through ductwork. These air passages must stay clean, and it’s a job for professionals, not do-it-yourself enthusiasts. Experts will help you seal any leaky ducts, which can boost the efficiency of your HVAC equipment up to 20%. How often should we service the HVAC system? As a rule of thumb, it’s best to call us for regular service to inspect, clean, and maintain your equipment every fall and spring, in advance of the coldest and hottest times of the year. Your Houston company or home will see the lowest total cost of ownership of the HVAC system when arranging for regular service, since it’s easier to spot problems and solve them when they’re small and less severe. When do I need to replace the system’s HVAC filters? Ideally, you will replace the filter every 90 days as the seasons change. However, if you have people with respiratory ailments, if anyone smokes, or if someone has allergies, you may need to change filters more often, such as monthly. Consult the manufacturer for details, and ask your health care professional for advice on how frequently filters need to be swapped. Can I schedule a repair service call over the weekend? Absolutely! We are always open 7 days a week, ready to answer your call and dispatch an expert to fix your HVAC, electrical, or plumbing issue. What can I do to maintain the exterior components of my HVAC system? In between regular service calls, it’s a good idea to go outside every couple of weeks and look at the HVAC equipment, getting rid of debris, weeds, leaves, and dirt that may accumulate. Blockages can harm the equipment or make it work less efficiently. You’ll always want to make a quick inspection after a major storm hits Houston. Why should I request your services over another home service company? When you need expert attention for your Houston area home's plumbing, heating, or air conditioning system, you want to know that the job will be done right the first time. All employees undergo background checks and drug tests. With ARS/Rescue Rooter, you can rest assured that all of our services come complete with our worry-free Exceptional Service Guarantee. In addition to treating you and your property with respect—calling before we arrive, using shoe covers and drop cloths as needed—we guarantee that you'll be satisfied with our work, as set out in a written estimate you approve before we start. If you're dissatisfied for any reason, we'll make every effort to meet your expectations. It's that simple. Why Do Houston Residents and Business Owners Require HVAC Services? As a leading Houston air conditioning company, ARS®/Rescue Rooter® frequently receives service calls during periods of high humidity, with customers needing a tune-up or repair of their HVAC system. It’s no wonder: Houston is known for its extremely humid climate, in particular between June and August. August is typically the warmest month in Houston, at about 94 degrees Fahrenheit . During periods of high humidity the temperature in Houston feels much hotter. Therefore, it’s essential to have a reliable air conditioner to keep your employees and customers or family members comfortable throughout the summertime. Rest assured that the team at ARS/Rescue Rooter is standing by to help in your time of need. We’ll check out your HVAC equipment and do what it takes to fix or upgrade the system. What types of problems can humidity cause that HVAC systems are able to address? Homeowners and business owners report that their windows sometimes grow foggy during high humidity. Or, you may detect a musty smell inside the building. Generally, people notice that the air feels moist, which is unpleasant and distracting. Your central air conditioner will decrease humidity levels, as the unit’s coil condenses water vapor and then drains this excess liquid. Longtime residents know that Houston also gets hurricanes and strong storms, which can damage your HVAC system, requiring professional repairs. Flying debris can strike your exterior equipment. It’s prudent to tour your property after a storm to assess any damage that will require professional repairs. Remember that these storms also can cause plumbing leaks and damaged water lines that a plumbing service such as ARS/Rescue Rooter can fix. After a flood, customers will call us because the rising water level damages their water heater. Do not try to use your water heater if it has been submerged. There is a risk of fire, especially when an unlicensed amateur attempts to check out the equipment. Heavy storm flooding can also pose problems for your lavatory. It’s not uncommon for people in Houston to find that storm surges and torrential rains lead to backed-up sewer lines. When the sewer can’t drain effectively, you may notice that your toilet is draining slower than usual. Call us for assistance if you detect this problem. Another issue after floods in Houston is leaking pipes in area businesses and homes. Our dispatcher will strive to book an appointment for service at a time that’s most convenient for you. Learn More About Houston If you have recently purchased a home or have started a business in Houston, the team at ARS/Rescue Rooter wants to welcome you to this vibrant community. Houston is renowned for being the largest city by population in Texas (it’s the fourth-biggest U.S. city ). It began as a settlement in Harrisburg in 1826. Today, Houston is a significant producer of oil and petrochemical products. High technology companies also flock to the area, where the Texas Medical Center is the city’s biggest employer. There are plenty of attractions and landmarks that set Houston apart as a jewel of a city. As plumbing professionals, we certainly appreciate the design that went into making the Gus S. Wortham “dandelion” design water fountain at Allen Parkway. Houston is also home to Sugar Hill recording studio, where Beyonce recorded her iconic “Dangerously in Love” song. It’s also attractive to engineering enthusiasts, who come to Houston to marvel at the Fred Hartman cable bridge.

We suggest scheduling maintenance twice a year in the Spring and Fall seasons. Why is my thermostat screen black/blank? This issue can be fixed by either flipping on a breaker that has been flipped off or simply replacing old batteries. How often should I change my filters? It is best to change less expensive filters every 30 days, midgrade filters every 60-90 days, and some filters once a year. If you have pets, it is recommended to change filters more frequently. If I have a heat pump is it supposed to ice over? Yes. Does lowering the temperature on my thermostat make the air blow colder? When the unit blows longer, it eventually cools down the home.

Fantastic service by Bellaire AC today... and specially Andrew D. and his crew who replaced our furnace today (just on time for the freeze) with professionalism, and in a fast, clean manner! We highly recommend Bellaire AC! Elena Vega 23:50 18 Feb 25 Andre Gomez is the best! He is very thorough, knowledgable, professional, and patient. Our heating system would not go on, and by phone he walked me through all the processes to check for problems. He spent a great amount of time with me and explained step-by-step what to do. Andre solved our problem with his expertise and patience! Patti Bailey 03:46 17 Feb 25 In these current times, then customer service is usually terrible or just completely absent, Bellaire Air Conditioning is truly a breath of fresh air. (Yes, pun intended.) Now, I have had 3 different occasions where they worked on my house and all 3 times have been exemplary. Charlie, Michael and Andres are the epitome of professionalism. More than that, they really tried to give me the best solutions. I've had the arduous task of working with various HVAC companies over the years and sadly, many of them just try to gouge the consumer. Bellaire AC treated me like a neighbor. I greatly appreciate their insight and top-notch service. Paul Swen 23:38 05 Feb 25 We had a semi annual check. Our tech, Andres, was extremely thorough and made recommendations on how to keep our drain line clean and shorten the line from what a previous company suggested. He also recommended insulating the enclosed area where the indoor AC and heating are housed. I highly recommend Bellaire Air Conditioning. We have had them for over 6 years. I like that they explain what they’re checking and how it looks while they’re here. Laura Nine 15:46 02 Feb 25 Had our semi-annual maintenance today, and the very capable Andres was our technician. He was very friendly, thorough, and knowledgeable. Bellaire Air Conditioning installed our units in 2016, and we rely on them for all our maintenance.

When choosing an AC repair company, consider their experience, licensing, reviews, and availability for 24/7 emergency services to ensure reliable and efficient repairs for your air conditioning system. What is included in an AC repair estimate? An AC repair estimate typically includes the cost of labor, any necessary replacement parts, and additional charges for diagnostics or specialized equipment if required to fix the issue. Can AC repairs be covered by insurance? AC repairs may be covered by insurance, depending on the type of coverage and the cause of the issue. Homeowners or warranty policies may provide some coverage for AC system repairs. What allergens can be reduced with AC maintenance? Regular HVAC maintenance can reduce common indoor allergens such as dust, pollen, and pet dander by improving air filtration, removing debris, and ensuring optimal system performance. How does refrigerant affect air conditioner performance? The amount and condition of the refrigerant in an air conditioner directly impact its performance. Proper refrigerant charge is crucial for efficient cooling, energy savings, and longevity of the system. What are the environmental impacts of AC repair? The environmental impacts of AC repair can include the release of refrigerants, improper disposal of old parts, and energy consumption during the repair process, which can contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental pollution. How can I improve my AC’s energy efficiency? Improving your AC's energy efficiency can be achieved by regularly maintaining the unit, keeping the air filters clean, ensuring proper insulation, and considering upgrading to a more energy-efficient model. air conditioner repair houston, ac repair houston, air conditioning repair houston, air conditioning service houston, air conditioning houston, heating repair houston, hvac houston, hvac repair houston, houston hvac company, furnace repair houston, air conditioning installation houston, all star ac All Star A/C, Plumbing & Electrical #1 HVAC, Plumbing & Electrical Services in Houston How Can We Help?

Tanner, the last Tech was really personable and very, very knowledgeable in his field. I'd brought up some concerns about a possible solenoid or capacitor issue, so Tanner told me and showed me what he was looking for, showed me results and described what would be the normal tolerances. No company has to do this, and understandably, a lot of people don't want others looking over their shoulders when they're trying to work, but Tanner was a champ and he gave me some great insights as to what was going on inside the compressors. With great customer service, very well established processes and technology, i.e. alerts, tracking, invoice and feedback generation etc., I feel validated in my choice of A/C companies. I always come off a lot better educated after working with and talking with Moss! Can't send enough thanks. You guys rock! Debra Kahan 2 weeks ago Tanner was great on the routine service checkup.

Dallas AC Replacement Tips Dallas Plumbing & Air Conditioning April 18, 2016 12:15 pm Dallas AC Replacement – Getting Your AC Unit Replaced Is Important You must think carefully about how well your air conditioner is working. Unfortunately, it can be easy for an AC unit in the Dallas-Fort Worth area to wear out and break down. You might need to get a new AC unit installed in your home. Considering how hot conditions can be in the summer, it is important to look for a new model as soon as possible. Fortunately, you can get a great Dallas AC replacement service to help you out with getting your old AC unit fixed up and replaced as needed. It is important to see what you are getting out of this. When Do I Replace My Home AC Unit There are many points that you need to consider when it comes to getting a replacement: You’ll need a replacement if your AC unit is at least ten years of age. Your model will more than likely be out of date. You should see what the humidity in your home is like. You’ll need a new AC model if your home is too humid during the summer. Excessive dust is a sign of a need to get your air conditioner replaced. A poorly operating unit can pull particles from different areas, thus leaving added dust around your home. Excess noises in your air conditioner are clear signs of a need to get your unit replaced. The parts within your air conditioner might be at risk of harm. The key is that an older model will not be as effective as a newer one. An older model will have worn out and will need to be replaced as soon as possible. Fortunately, there are plenty of newer options for people in the DFW area to look for. The key is to just find one that you know will be suitable for your cooling demands. Choosing a New Air Conditioning Unit After you determine that you need to replace your air conditioner, you can choose a good new option. There are many good considerations to see: Think about the square footage that the AC unit can handle. See that the model can generate enough cool air to fill all the spots in your home. Check on how much power it generates. Air conditioners have become more energy efficient in recent years. Check on the footprint that your unit will take up. Air conditioners come in many sizes. You need to choose one that will fit into the foundation that an old model might have been in. Don’t forget to take a good look at the price of the AC unit. Make sure you check for one that offers enough coverage in your home at a good price. You should look carefully when finding a great Dallas AC replacement option for your home. A new AC unit can be critical for keeping your home comfortable and relaxed. By choosing the right option, you will keep your home comfortable.

Read More The absolute relief I felt working with such an honest and organized company after dealing with a different HVAC company that overcharged us and failed to provide any documentation was so welcome. Immediately when I called Quality 1 Energy Systems in a panic and on the verge of tears I knew that I was in good hands from the moment they answered the phone. They have truly gone above and beyond by getting someone out to us ASAP to diagnose our AC issues, and the technician who came was incredibly professional, knowledgeable, and thorough. We received a detailed report with photos showing everything that was inspected and what needed to be repaired - everything was clearly laid out, which was not our experience with the other company we had worked with. It's a HUGE comfort knowing that we can trust and rely on Quality 1 Energy when we need them most. We haven't completed the repairs yet, but based on their transparency and professionalism, I have no doubt we'll continue to be thrilled with their work and I will be sure to update my review again after the repairs are completed. We plan to stick with this company for all future maintenance because they've earned our trust and treated us like family. I would highly recommend Quality 1 Every Systems for any of your AC or heating needs! UPDATE: Just as I had assumed, Q1ES continued to go above and beyond expectations. I'm updating this review as I sit in my COLD house after they completed my AC repair this afternoon (they arrived early and got the job done quickly too while still being extremely thorough). Zak even personally stopped by to check-in, which showed me even more just how great these guys are and how much they truly care for and value their customers. I will always choose to work with family-owned companies after this wonderful experience. I am SO grateful for Zak and his entire team for their hard work and high-quality service and look forward to being a lifelong customer!

I always had a spring and fall maintenance program in place. While I never had any issues, or needed major repair, I felt that it was the right time to replace it. I am a firm believer in Trane products having had multiple units at multiple homes all with a consistent good experience. I went to Trane’s website for a list of authorized dealers. I also asked a person I knew who is in the construction industry if his company had any experiences with Trane HVAC companies. He gave me a recommendation. I chose three companies and asked for quotes. All were certified Trane Comfort Specialists. One was the friend’s recommendation, one was a company that had performed warranty service on a mini-split system I have and the last one was a company that had good reviews. The dealer with whom I had a prior experience simply sent me an emailed price quote. The second sent a technician by who said someone will be back in contact with a price. It too was sent by email. Zach, with Quality 1 Energy Systems, came out, examined the system and took multiple pictures of it . He then spent time asking about my expectations and my likes/dislikes with the existing system. He shared his photos and made some suggestions including changing out some old duct work that should have been done twenty years ago. He later sent a detailed quote with all the individual pricing and terms. He followed it up with a phone call to answer any questions. To be fair to all companies, I sent them specific questions requesting updated figures for yearly maintenance pricing on our multiple systems, additional duct work costs, and labor charges for any Trane warranty work should it be required. One responded with caveats and minimal detail while the other, not at all. I chose Quality 1 which also happened to be the one my friend recommended. On installation day, Kevin and his team arrived and quickly started the changeover to the new system. They covered the floor and were careful in their handling of both the removal of the old equipment and the installation of the new.

Still have questions? Please do not hestiate to contact Aire Serv. How can I prepare my HVAC system for seasonal changes? Have your AC inspected and your coils cleaned before summer starts. Before winter, check your heating system, replace air filters, and test your thermostat. Routine seasonal maintenance will help to prevent breakdowns when your system is needed the most. Why does my AC make a loud noise when it runs? Banging, rattling, or squealing might be caused by motor trouble, compressor issues, or loose parts. Strange sounds shouldn’t be ignored because they usually indicate the need for a repair. How do I know if my air ducts need repair or replacement? If you have inconsistent temperatures, skyrocketing energy costs, or weak airflow, you might have damaged ductwork. Gaps and leaks in ducts will affect efficiency, and in some situations, replacing the older ductwork is the best solution. How often should I schedule maintenance for my commercial HVAC system? A commercial HVAC system needs to be serviced at least twice a year to make sure it operates efficiently. More frequent maintenance may be needed for businesses with high occupancy, like offices or restaurants with heavy HVAC usage. Need HVAC Service? Call Aire Serv Now Reviews Trusted by Dallas Families I have no doubt that your products are good, and your service consultant, Gerardo Vinilay, Is superb. He is very knowledgeable, communicative and sympathetic, and I feel like I can trust him completely. I’m so glad you have such a wonderful service consultant I feel like I can rely on. Thank you all for your great service! Shari Covens Dallas, TX From the time I placed my call for service everyone I have been in contact with at Aireserv has been great! Very pleased with the service that was provided by Kevin. I am not very savvy when it comes to technical things and he explained everything that was wrong with my system in great detail. He has a great personality and highly recommend! Courtney Hill Lewisville, TX Airserv is fantastic. I've used their service twice now and saw two different technicians. You'll see many reviews mentioning Jack Theilen with good reason. The guy is prompt, professional, hard working and transparent throughout. He even casually identified and corrected a completely unrelated plumbing issue while fixing our AC - you can trust these guys with your HVAC needs. Jordon Purcell Irving, TX I have a small high school girls reunion this weekend and realized one of my guest bedrooms was not cooling down. I didn't think anyone would be able to get it taken care of inside 3 days, but Jack Theilen came out and gave us a very reasonable estimate and said he could do it immediately. Jack was so sweet and even turned around one of our return vents that wasn't related to the project. He enlarged an existing return and installed a larger supply. The difference is amazing and I am so relieved! Highly recommend this company and especially Jack! Amanda Campbell Dallas, TX The attention to detail Romario Guevara had going over the HVAC units was unbelievable! The things he pointed out that had been neglected or were in need of repair makes me wonder if anyone has ever done such a thorough job as Romario did. Thank you for the quality of care that was taken servicing my two units! Theresa Chilcoat Addison, TX Kevin came out to tune up my client's AC system and troubleshoot an air flow concern. We were having a new roof installed at the time that he arrived - he braved the banging and pounding on the roof to get up in the attic to inspect/clean the inside air handler. He was also able to help shed some light on the air flow concern. Afterwards, he went outside to clean the coils on the exterior unit and was done within an hour. He debriefed me on the system, gave me some great insight into preventative maintenance and left a very tidy workspace when he finished. He was professional and courteous at all time. I'm a Realtor in DFW and have used Aire Serv in my own home in the past. I will continue to refer my clients to Aire Serv! Thank you so much! Joshua Pool Plano, TX Air serv was able to accommodate my repair quickly for next day service. The tech went above and beyond my expectations and provided a detailed report with pics prior to leaving. Ask for Kevin Hill when you schedule your appt. He is very knowledgeable, professional, and understanding of your needs. Stan Newton Forney, TX I have used both their phone number and website to request service and both have been easy to use and quick to set up an appointment. Technicians have always been friendly, knowledgeable and professional. Prices for service have been reasonable and with no unnecessary up-charges. I will continue to use the company and recommend it to others as well.

Frequently Asked Questions What happens when you come to give me an estimate for a new AC & heating system? If you contact us for an estimate, one of our Comfort Advisors will take a look at your current system, ask you questions about which features and options you are looking for, learn more about your budget and determine how much you are currently spending to cool and heat your home. When we develop an estimate, we take all of these factors into account, plus any opportunities to save money through local and federal rebates or incentives. We will also suggest other improvements to help your home be more energy efficient and to lower your utility bills, whether that means adding weatherization, insulation or taking other measures. How do I know if I need a new system? You can save up to 40% on your home cooling costs simply by investing in a new, more energy and cost-efficient system. That said, just because you can get a new unit doesn’t always mean that you need to. Trust ABC to use a “whole house” approach to help you decide when you should consider replacing your system rather than making repairs. What about manufacturer and utility company rebates? Manufacturers and utility providers have a wide variety of rebates and special offers, usually seasonally. All of our Comfort Advisors are fully informed and well-versed in all necessary programs to ensure you get the best deal possible from manufacturers and local utilities. For more information, ask your Comfort Advisor. Can you work on my gas furnace or heat pump? Although we don’t have to use our heating system (gas furnace or heat pump) often here in Austin, we want to make sure our homes stay warm and cozy when temperatures drop. Just like we can help keep your home cool in summer, ABC’s pros can keep your heating system working its best in the cooler months. We can also make sure your heater is ready for cold weather by performing an annual tune-up. Thinking about a career with the ABC AC & Heating team?

He’s a great guy to have on my home maintenance team, knowing he is there in the event the need should arise for emergency service. Thanks Scott! Will M 2024-10-16 Found Capitol Cooling while managing vendors for a national data center company, our experiences with the bigger local HVAC outfits were consistently terrible- huge markups, suspiciously long lead times for parts, and undertrained techs needing multiple attempts to perform a repair. Capitol Cooling was able to perform all of our needed repairs (we have over 50 different units, various manufacturers, totaling over 2000 mechanical tons), without having to make more than one visit, all at a 30-40% cost savings over our contracted vendors. Capitol Cooling is now our company’s contracted vendor for all of our HVAC needs, from maintenance to repairs. They also responded immediately to a family member’s broken home A/C unit early this summer, and worked late into that same Friday evening to make sure it was repaired. We signed up for the reasonably priced quarterly maintenance plan for our home A/Cs as well. If anyone is needing fair, skilled, and proactive HVAC services, 12/10 would recommend Capitol Cooling. There aren’t very many good companies run by good people out there anymore, but this is definitely one of them. Kelly A 2024-10-02 Fantastic experience with Capital Cooling!

REQUEST SERVICE Customer Testimonials Air Conditioner Repair in Austin, TX 78748 July 22, 2024 “Stay far away from this company. The tech named Daniel Walker is nothing more than high priced used car salesman. He had no idea about the laws regarding R-22 and attempted to scare me into getting a new system because he said he can’t find R-22 and if they could it would cost a couple thousand dollars. How can anybody trust these people when the homeowner knows more about their business than the tech? The current company fixing my system had 2 bottles of R-22 on his truck and a pallet back at the warehouse. This company I’m going with is charging me $500. Compared to Daniel’ quote range of $8,000 to $14,000 this is a no brainer.” - Michael S. Response from Blue Air Heating and Air Conditioning Michael, We have received your feedback and per our phone conversation, I have sent all your concerns to our General Manager as well as the owner of the company. We appreciate any and all feedback and thank you for taking the time to tell us about your experience. As I mentioned on the phone, we never want you to feel like we are using pressure to purchase a repair and I am deeply sorry that you felt this way after our visit. Our management team is on this and will ensure that this never happens again. Furnace Installation in Austin, TX 78731 June 15, 2021 Blue Air is great! In addition to doing a great job with the actual installation of my furnace, they followed through with every single thing they promised. They said that they were going to be there at 8:00am, and they were. They said that they were going to e-mail me a copy of the warranty, and they did. They were on-time, courteous, and did it all at a competitive price. That kind of dedication and follow-through goes a long way with customer service. I highly recommend Blue Air! I wrote the above paragraph 8 years ago, and I just wanted to amend it. I recently used BlueAir to install a full HVAC system in my new house two years ago. Since the installation, I have had to rely on BlueAir for some follow-up work. Both Marianna and Mark have been extremely accommodating, and follow through to ensure that their customers are satisfied. Marianna even took my phone call after hours when I needed to speak with her. Thanks for the great customer service!

It is also one of the most neglected energy saving opportunities. Most heating and cooling systems are not properly maintained, serviced or tuned up and are not running at optimal levels. Others may not have been installed properly, were sized incorrectly or have outdated and inefficient equipment. Add to that, most have leaky and improperly sized air distribution or duct systems. Each of these problems represents significant energy waste. You can tap into this enormous energy saving potential by bringing the HVAC equipment and air distribution system up to current standards. While many people immediately turn to system replacement as the answer, there are a number of more affordable solutions to consider first – such as service maintenance, tune ups or component updating. You should also have your ducts checked to see if they simply need to be sealed or properly sized. AC Tune-Up and Service Maintenance The Department of Energy calculates that a regularly maintained system can save 10% of your AC bill. Preventive maintenance will detect small problems before they become big ones, keep your system working at maximum efficiency and minimize costly repairs. Just like cars and other mechanical equipment needs maintenance and tune-ups, so does your heating and cooling system. It is recommended that they be serviced at least 2 times per year. Austin Star offers complete tune-ups based upon the type of unit. Air Conditioning and Heating Service Options Request one of the HVAC Service Options below. Duct Services Distributing Comfort Throughout Your Home A central heating and cooling system in a home plays a similar role to that of the human heart. Just as the heart enables the circulation of blood throughout the human body, the central air conditioner and furnace are responsible for supplying air to each part of the home where conditioned air is needed. This is done by channeling the air through a series of connected ducts running through walls, crawlspaces and attics. Just like the human heart, it is important that the flow is evenly distributed to provide a healthy, comfortable system for your home. Many factors can have an impact on the distribution of air flow in your home and so it is important to consult with our energy specialists to make sure that you are getting the best results from your existing system. Duct testing and sealing is an affordable solution that can help ensure that your heating and cooling systems are running at peak performance. Beware in just sealing duct work home owners can make the problem worse, as it will choke down the airflow causing equipment failure. Some contractors do not address your duct system because of the lack of knowledge or tools to measure the performance of your duct system. If they are not testing they are guessing , and have no idea how to fix problems or even where to begin. Weatherization Weatherization is a building science requiring a combination of knowledge and skills that very few companies have. When you think of energy efficiency, most likely weatherization is not the first thing that comes to mind. However, this is the first and most effective place to start. Many times there are areas in the home where a draft can be felt around windows, doors, and other areas. If this is the case, air is escaping in and out of the home and reducing the effectiveness of running your heater or air conditioner. This may seem like an insignificant flow of air, but the cumulative effect could be equivalent to having a large hole in your wall. Obviously, having a large hole in your wall would be unacceptable, and you would want to do something about it immediately. That’s where weatherization comes in. Fortunately, this is one of the least expensive improvements that can be done to improve energy efficiency. But before undertaking this task, be sure to have a Home Energy Audit performed to detect the air leaks and assess your ventilation needs. Caulk, Weather Stripping and Insulation As we’ve learned, a “drafty” house is the result of air leakage or infiltration through cracks and openings. While many are easy to locate, such as around windows and doors, many are hidden in attics and crawlspaces, behind the stairs, around outlets and openings for appliances, and so on. Properly sealing these leaks with caulk, spray foam, and weather stripping can greatly impact both your comfort and your utility bills as the furnace and air conditioner have to work less hard to keep your home at the proper temperature. (Note: sealing leaks will not solve any problems related to lack of insulation which is needed to reduce heat loss.) Most experts agree that caulking and weather stripping should pay for themselves in energy savings within a year. For particularly “leaky” homes, air infiltration may account for 30 percent or more of the home’s heating and cooling costs and contribute to moisture, dust, insects and other issues with the home. For specific information about caulking, Indoor Air Quality Service Most people spend over 90% of their time indoors, not knowing that the air they are breathing may be more polluted than the airoutside. The Environmental Protection Agency has reported that indoor air pollution levels can be 100 times higher than the air outdoors. Breathing contaminated air puts the health of you and your family at risk. In fact, the American College of Allergist says that 50% of illnesses are caused or aggravated by polluted indoor air. So take control of your indoor air quality by reducing pollutants that can contribute to headache, lung irritation and fatigue as well as more long-term conditions such as asthma, allergies and infectious diseases. Beware of Sick Building Syndrome Every day, active families generate a large quantity of indoor pollutants. This includes hair, dander, pollen, dust, dirt, smoke and other irritants. This toxic soup is cycled repeatedly through the HVAC system and deposited tShroughout the house. Continuous exposure to polluted air can worsen allergies and asthma and could lead to chronic lung disease. The problem of poor indoor air quality has reached epidemic proportions, and the EPA has classified IAQ as one of the top five most pressing environmental hazards. Contaminated air also negatively impacts HVAC equipment efficiency. Dirt and dust mix with water to form a sticky paste that coats the components inside the evaporator coil. Once this happens, the thermal energy transfer process is degraded and your air conditioner must then work longer and harder. As a result, utility bills escalate and the unit may break down more often.

FAQ About HVAC in Cedar Park How often should I service my heater and AC? Advanced Air Conditioning + Heating in Cedar Park recommends servicing your heater and AC at least once a year. Regular maintenance helps ensure your systems run efficiently, prolongs their lifespan, and can prevent costly breakdowns. Ideally, schedule AC maintenance in the spring and heater maintenance in the fall. What are the signs that my AC needs repair? Common signs your AC needs repair include reduced cooling efficiency, unusual noises, frequent cycling on and off, and higher energy bills. If you notice any of these issues, contact Advanced Air Conditioning and Heating for a prompt diagnosis and repair to prevent further damage and restore comfort to your home. How much do heater and AC repairs typically cost? The cost of heater and AC repairs varies depending on the issue’s complexity and the parts required.

Yes, Advanced Air Conditioning + Heating offers emergency HVAC repair services for both heaters and AC units in Cedar Park. We understand that HVAC issues can arise unexpectedly and require immediate attention. Our team is available 24/7 to address your urgent repair needs and restore your system’s functionality promptly. What size HVAC system do I need for my home? Determining the right size HVAC system is crucial for efficiency and comfort. It depends on various factors including the size of your home, the insulation quality, number of windows, and the local climate in Cedar Park.

Testimonials What People Say About Us I highly recommend Chuck’s AC!! They’re fast(key in hot TX summers), friendly, honest, offer quality service..I only have good things to say about them. Added bonus that you’re supporting a local, family owned company. I had them install a whole new unit on a whim and plan on using them for years to come for HVAC maintenance! 5.0 470 Reviews I’ve been using Chuck’s A/C for 10 years and have always had great experiences. They were there for me every time my aging unit wheezed and stuttered. When it came time to replace it I shopped around but Chuck’s price, service and integrity won out. I highly recommend them if you’re looking for a business you can build a relationship with, trust and turn to when you need a hand. 5.0 470 Reviews I had them out to service my A/C very helpful knew their stuff. they communicated when they were on the way over and arrived on time- didnt leave me hanging all day for sometime between 9-5. would recommend them for any heating and air conditioning work you need. 5.0 470 Reviews I called Chuck’s on a Friday afternoon in July. I was sure that they would tell me what all the others would. That it would be Monday before they could see me. Chuck’s got there the same day. And I was shocked to find out that all I needed was a wire repaired. I was ready to be taken to the cleaners. I was sure that they would tell me I needed a new system,(since mine was so old). I would recommend them to anyone. 5.0 470 Reviews Chuck is a lifesaver! Our AC stopped cooling on a Saturday when the temperature outside was 106. After calling several places who listed themselves as being open but not answering the phone, Chuck himself picked up and saved the day. After talking with me for a few minutes and walking me through a few tests to see what the actual problem was, he determined that is was just the thermostat that had gone bad, which I could run to the store and purchase immediately. He saved us a repair visit and did not even charge for the time he spent helping me. Later that evening, he called back to make sure we were doing all right. We were, thanks to him.

Call Us 512-963-0376 Building a new home? We provide New Construction HVAC Installation Services. We partner with General Contractors and Owner-Builders on new construction projects. If you have acquired construction plans for a new residential or commercial building, we're your ideal HVAC installation partner. A crucial first step is obtaining accurate HVAC load calculations and duct layouts. To streamline this, we recommend our trusted partner at https://hvacsizing.com/ for detailed reports. Once you have your completed HVAC load calculation report and duct design, we will seamlessly take over, ensuring your new building's HVAC system is installed precisely according to your plans and local building codes. Comfortable Homes Start with the Right System Ensuring your home stays comfortable year-round starts with an appropriately sized air conditioning and heating system. A properly sized AC and heating system will provide efficient heating in the winter without unnecessary strain, helping prevent temperature fluctuations and promoting consistent warmth. During the summer, correct sizing is key for effective cooling and dehumidification; an undersized unit will struggle to maintain comfortable temperatures, while an oversized one may cycle too frequently, failing to reduce humidity adequately.

READ MORE REVIEWS Air Duct Repair in Cedar Park, TX 78613 January 11, 2024 “I cannot say enought about this company and the team that did the work for us. I had a gas dryer vent issue that recurrently clogged because of improper installation 4 years ago. Richard was thorough and accurate in his assessment of a permanent solution to a recurring problem. Good explanations on the three options complete with cost estimates. When I selected an option and awarded the work, the team scheduled the repairs within the week. The team treated my home as if it was their own. They came promptly as scheduled and were efficient in completing the work. Richard even called to make sure about a detail later in the same day they did the work. The price was fair and reasonable compared to the other quotes which would not have resolved the design problem Richard found and fixed. This company is 5 star all around. DRHVAC is the most professional contract team I have had the pleasure to work with.” - Julie P. Gas Furnace Repair in Leander, TX 78641 December 8, 2023 “I can not say enough about this company and the amazing work that they do. Richard has been our service technician and has always gone above and beyond to make sure everything was done correctly. Believe me we had a challenging system that was installed many years ago by another company/ installer. Richard figured everything out and the system has been running flawlessly.” - Charles G.

""Great service at a reasonable price."" Look no further for your A/C guy than Austin’s Green Air! - Brent B. ""Super pro. Super helpful."" I called and left a message on a Sunday and a rep from Austin’s Green AC called me back that same day to set up an appointment on Monday. Sonny, their technician showed up on time, was friendly and helpful, and very service and customer-oriented. He explained what he was doing, suggested service options, and was extremely helpful in helping me decide what made the most sense for my situation and budget. - Perry D. ""I highly recommend Casimir and look forward to working with this company again the future."" Casimir is an absolute professional and honest businessman as evidenced by our recent experience with him. We found him easy to understand and made us feel comfortable with our questions. Rather than invoice for the work he did in fact perform, he was gracious enough to waive his fee because his repair did not in fact solve the problem. That is a super standup move in my book and one that you rarely see these days. - Jason F. ""Great Service!!"" hey truly made this a stress-free experience for us. I highly recommend this company. - Leigh Ann S. ""Very nice group & we're very grateful."" Fast response & honest evaluation of our needs. Both indoor & outdoor units replaced affordably. - Sabrina A. ""Excellent service every time! Highly recommend!!!"" I was blown away with how dirty and impacted our mini split system was (the water was black with chunks of gunk, eek!)!! Sonny was able to get it cleaned out like new and the air is fresh again! Thank you guys for taking pride in your work and helping us stay healthy and care for our a/c system. - Customer ""10/10 would absolutely recommend!"" Sonny came out and worked through multiple solutions with me to get my unit running in optimal condition. He talked through the WHY I was experiencing issues and helped explain ways for me to maintain the unit in the future. - Andy E. ""Honest and Dependable!"" I love supporting small, family-run businesses with integrity and these folks are the real deal. - Bethany A.

With triple digit temperatures in the summertime, you might second-guess attending that concert at Waterloo Park . Thankfully, Austin has no shortage of lakes to paddle in and waterparks to cool off at. Lady Bird Lake is Austin’s most popular spot for kayaking, thanks to a ban on motorized watercraft, which means tranquil waters for rowing. For soaking thrills, consider Typhoon Texas, an outdoor waterpark with twisting slides and a long, lazy river, or head over to Kalahari Resorts, which boasts the nation’s largest indoor waterpark, in nearby Round Rock. You can also escape the heat at one of our fine museums, such as the Blanton Museum of Art or Bullock Texas State History Museum. Or just stay in. With a functioning air conditioning system, you can relax in comfort while live streaming Austin City Limits .",7113.0,

He quickly found the problem and fixed it as soon as possible. I am now sitting in a cool home thanks to him. We will be using him again if we ever need to and he is highly recommended Mike E. Had a great experience with Resilience for the replacement of my AC unit. During the estimate process Yusuan was extremely quick to respond and was able to provide a bid for a Trane unit that was well under the bids that I had received. He and his team were able to get the unit replaced in a timely manner and were friendly and professional throughout the process. I really got the sense that they took pride in their work and were equally happy with the result. Will definetely be using them to replace my other unit when the time comes. Erik Q. I came back from a trip to find the temperature at 87 degrees and wouldn’t cool passed 83. After reaching out to others, Resilience (Yusuan) responded quickly and was very professional Yusuan noticed that the Freon was extremely low, after replacing the Freon my problem was resolved. My place is finally comfortable again! The follow-up test would be covered by the $85 service call. Frank M.

A strategically placed UV light is very effective at killing close to one hundred percent of these harmful pollutants. Installing a UV HVAC system in your condensing unit — the air handler — provides a cost- effective method to clean all the air as it passes through the system. Why Install a UV Light in the HVAC System? The volume of air inside your home is immense. Treating it effectively as a whole is nearly impossible because UV lights can also be harmful to humans. Inside your air handler, however, is a different story. Your HVAC system draws the air into its evaporator unit and forces it out through air registers — the vents — placed around your home. Installing the UV light inside your evaporator unit makes perfect sense, as the air must pass over the UV light as it is circulated.

LEAVE A REVIEW Air Conditioner Installation in Austin, TX 78704 June 2, 2025 “We hired Smart Air to install new HVAC systems in two homes and the work itself seems great. Their team was professional, efficient, and left both jobs in great shape. We were genuinely impressed with the quality of the installation and their overall knowledge. That’s why it’s so disappointing to be chasing them down over something that should have been easy: the rebate applications that they promised to handle. They are on the Austin Energy list for participation contractors to apply for the city energy efficiency rebates. These rebates were an important part of our decision to go with Energy Star units, and we chose Smart Air in part because they assured us they’d take care of the paperwork. Eleven months later, despite multiple requests and reminders, the rebate applications have not been sent in. In the meantime, our current president is threatening to eliminate Energy Star rebates. It’s not just frustrating—it feels like the last 5% of a great job is still missing. And it matters. We're talking over $1000, here, not a little rebate check. We’re not the kind of people who like leaving bad reviews. It’s a call-in from satisfied (but weary) customers who would love to be fully satisfied. Smart Air, please follow through. You’ve already done the hard part. Just close the loop. —Ben & Patti” - Patricia E. Other Maintenance in West Lake Hills, TX 78746 May 27, 2025 “Your employees park like entitled assholes.

He took the time to show us special features of the controls; some of which we would have never even thought of using. The control is a Wi-Fi-based control which provides us many options. By the time the Technician left, we were very comfortable with the controls. The humidity and temperature are controlled so much better than with our old unit and the utility bill is now lower. I would recommend this company to anyone without reservation."" Dave "" They have serviced my home A/C unit for over 8 years, and I am always impressed by their level of professionalism. They are always quick to respond, and I know they will get the job done right. "" EZ "" Spring is here and of course our AC went out in the middle of the night. We called them on a recommendation from a friend in the morning and they came out right away and fixed our air conditioner. Best AC repair company in Austin in my honest opinion.

Verified Review, Google Maps, 2025 Asked Frank from Elite Heating and Air Conditioning to give second opinion on AC unit that wasn’t cooling. His estimate is much much more reasonable for my situation and I’m switching from another company to Elite for all future work! Robin R. Verified Review, Google Maps, 2025 When To Repair Your Austin AC System It can be hard to tell if your AC unit is in need of repair. These are some common signs that you should repair your current central cooling system: Your AC unit doesn’t start easily. If your cooling unit isn’t turning on as easily as it should, it may be time for a repair. This is common in older air conditioning systems or systems with a faulty part. Your home or business isn’t staying cool throughout the day. If you notice that your property is not able to retain cold temperatures like it used to, it’s probably a sign that your AC system needs repair. A functioning central cooling system should get your home cool and keep it cool without struggle. Your AC unit is loud. Air conditioners should not make loud, noticeable noises on a consistent basis. Of course, it is normal for your cooling unit to make some noise, as long as it’s not too loud. Any grinding, squealing, or whistling noises are abnormal. Contact Elite AC & Plumbing if you hear any uncommon noises coming from your air conditioning system. Your indoor air quality isn’t great. A functioning AC system should properly maintain your home’s air quality. If your air conditioning isn’t working correctly, you may notice more dirt and dust throughout your property. It is important to contact your AC repair specialist if you notice a decrease in your home’s air quality. Frequently Asked Questions About AC & HVAC What HVAC Services do you offer?

Had got a quote from another company and they told me it would be 5k for a coil cleaning. Omar came and told me that my issue was not only the coils but I had a leak as well, ans that a coil cleaning would not fix my problem. His crew arrived by 1030 and by 130 they were done with the install. Very professional, efficient, and straightforward. Highly recommend this company and his service.

I talked to about 4 different companies and ABC Austin Service Express provided the fastest, competitive and best customer service. Omar was very diligent in getting me a quote with my requirements and I wanted to have the unit raised from the ground and to have copper lines and electrical wires be protected by an enclosure.
