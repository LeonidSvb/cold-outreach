# Cold Outreach AI Automation Platform

Modular AI-powered system for processing 10K-30K leads/month with intelligent personalization and multi-channel outreach.

---

## Users & Value

- **Primary user / persona:** Solo entrepreneur running AI automation/lead generation services
- **Jobs-to-be-done (JTBD):**
  - When I have raw CSV leads from various sources, I want to enrich them with AI-powered insights, so I can create highly personalized outreach that converts.
  - When I need to scale outreach to 10K+ leads/month, I want modular functions that work independently, so I can mix-match processing based on available data.

---

## Success Metrics

- **Primary Goal:** High reply rate and positive response rate leading to booked calls
- **Success Criteria:** Scalable processing of 10K-30K leads/month (target: 30K/month by Q2)

### 2. Data Flow Architecture
```
Input: raw_leads_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv
  ↓
Enrichment: + website_data + linkedin_insights + apify_intelligence
  ↓
AI Processing: + 10_icebreakers + subject_lines + offers + sequences
  ↓
Output: enriched_leads_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv → Google Sheets
```

### 3. Natural Language Orchestration
```bash
# Examples of natural language commands:
python orchestrator.py "Process 1000 leads from apollo_export.csv with full enrichment and icebreakers"
python orchestrator.py "Generate only icebreakers for existing_data.csv using LinkedIn focus"
python orchestrator.py "Batch process all CSVs in /raw folder with Apify enhancement"
```
