Website Intelligence Module - Development History

VERSION 1.0.0 - 2025-09-21
==========================

INITIAL RELEASE
- Created modular architecture following production script standards
- Implemented intelligent routing system (HTTP vs Apify)
- Built ultra-fast HTTP scraper with 50+ worker concurrency
- Added AI-powered content processing with OpenAI integration
- Created comprehensive site analysis with JavaScript detection
- Developed structured configuration system
- Added detailed prompts for AI processing
- Implemented batch processing for optimal performance

COMPONENTS CREATED:
- intelligence_router.py - Main orchestrator and pipeline coordinator
- site_analyzer.py - Website complexity analysis and routing decisions
- http_scraper.py - High-performance HTTP scraping with text extraction
- content_processor.py - AI-powered content analysis and summarization
- config.json - Comprehensive module configuration
- prompts/ - AI prompt templates for different analysis types

FEATURES:
- Smart domain routing based on JavaScript complexity
- Parallel processing with configurable worker limits
- Text-only extraction for optimal speed and accuracy
- AI summarization with personalization insights
- Contact information and technology detection
- Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Detailed analytics and performance tracking
- JSON and CSV export capabilities

ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS:
- Modular design for easy component replacement
- Async/await pattern for optimal concurrency
- Configuration-driven behavior for flexibility
- Structured prompts for consistent AI output
- Comprehensive logging and statistics tracking

PERFORMANCE TARGETS:
- HTTP scraping: 100+ domains/minute
- Apify processing: 20-30 domains/minute
- AI analysis: 5-10 domains/minute
- Cost optimization: ~$0.014 per domain average

NEXT PHASE PLANNED:
- Apify MCP integration implementation
- Dashboard generation for results visualization
- Enhanced error recovery and fallback mechanisms
- Google Sheets integration for data management
- Advanced analytics and reporting features

TECHNICAL DEBT:
- Apify router needs implementation (currently stubbed)
- Dashboard generation not yet implemented
- Advanced error recovery mechanisms needed
- Performance optimization for large batches

TESTING STATUS:
- Site analyzer: Manual testing completed
- HTTP scraper: Basic functionality tested
- Content processor: OpenAI integration verified
- Intelligence router: Pipeline logic tested
- Full integration: Pending comprehensive testing

DEPENDENCIES:
- aiohttp for async HTTP requests
- beautifulsoup4 for HTML parsing
- openai for AI content processing
- pandas for data export (optional)
- Standard library modules for core functionality

CONFIGURATION:
- Environment variables for API keys
- JSON configuration for all processing parameters
- Structured prompts in markdown format
- Flexible routing thresholds and limits
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring options
