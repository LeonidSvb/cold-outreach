QUALITY GUIDELINES:
- Extract specific, concrete information rather than generic statements
- Look for quantifiable achievements (growth %, client numbers, years of experience)
- Identify emotional triggers (company values, mission statements)
- Find time-sensitive information (recent launches, current initiatives)
- Prioritize information that would be impossible to know without visiting their site
- If information is unclear or not found, use null or empty arrays rather than guessing
