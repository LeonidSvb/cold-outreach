Read Now Nathan Eraut July 25, 2023 - Barbie marketing Barbie Marketing is Everywhere – And Places it’s Not By now you’ve probably seen some form of marketing for the Barbie movie, or at least heard someone mention it in conversation. How could you not? It’s estimated that the total marketing expenditure for the campaign was $150 million, more than the movie cost to make. Sure, the budget is big, but Warner Bros isn’t just dumping money into ads. The Barbie marketing team used a wide variety of unique, out-of-the-box marketing tactics including everything from brand partnerships to a Barbie-themed Airbnb in Malibu and much much more. The result? The marketing has now gone so mainstream that talking about it has become an internet inside joke, with a slew of people on social media posting photos of just about anything pink (think sunsets, random buildings) congratulating their marketing team on a job well done. With the movie earning $155 million in the US and another $182 million internationally through its opening weekend, it’s safe to say that the marketing was a success. In this blog, I’ll break down exactly what they did to achieve these results and how their unique strategy led to the creation of “the Barbie effect.” Read Now Nathan Eraut April 26, 2023 - Partner Network Advertising Diving Deep into Partner Network Advertising A 50% clickthrough rate might seem like every marketer’s dream, especially when paired with a $0.01 cost per click. Seeing this, you might think you have struck the advertising jackpot. But, as everyone knows, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is. When one of our TikTok campaigns showed abnormally “good” results like this, we decided to investigate why. The first thing we found was that we weren’t the only ones experiencing these weird results. Looking on Reddit, we found other TikTok advertisers sharing similar stories.

    "https://www.kiplingmedia.com/nfts-new-approach-fostering-brand-loyalty": "NFTs: A New Approach to Fostering Brand Loyalty Advertising Advertising / Creative / Marketing / Technology NFTs: A New Approach to Fostering Brand Loyalty Web 3.0 technologies like NFTs have gained popularity very quickly in the last two years. But, people still have a healthy dose of scepticism about this blockchain ‘revolution’ – and fair enough. The NFT space is saturated with fraud and is subject to some serious ups and downs. Some consider NFTs to be a bandwagon fad poised to ‘pop,’ while others position them as emerging tools that will revolutionize the marketing and investing landscapes. Either way, artists have been looking for a tool to better commodify their work for some time, and NFTs offer up a way to do so. While we undergo a rapid transition towards Web 3.0 and a digital economy of goods, more artists – musical, graphic, and otherwise – are producing digital works in an online, shareable space. NFTs emerged in response to artists’ need for a way to monetize their work. They’re also a great example of the influence marketers have, along with a potentially effective strategy for companies looking to create a more personalized customer-brand community. Samantha Kroontje September 30, 2022 Table Of Contents What are NFTs anyways? Nothing makes me think “huh?” like some NFT and blockchain news filling my inbox. But put simply, an NFT is a digital asset that represents basically any real-world item. They’ve been around for a while, but proliferated in recent years when people started trading digital art as NFTs – sometimes for millions of dollars . By definition, an NFT is a ‘nonfungible token,’ or an asset verified and stored on secure registers using blockchain technology. Blockchains such as Ethereum are a decentralized way to maintain data without relying on any one entity. They are ‘nonfungible’ because they are usually one-of-a-kind or uncopyable – that’s why you may have heard NFT advocates refer to them as creators of “digital scarcity.” Unlike bitcoin, which could be traded for other bitcoin with identical values, NFTs have unique identifiers and are considered to be unreplicable. This solves a big problem for artists in a space where any digital work is downloadable and copyright is difficult to regulate. So, essentially the idea is that the holder has exclusive ownership over this nonfungible, digital asset. Image Credit: OpenSea Can’t you just download or screenshot an NFT someone else owns? That’s the thing. Anyone can make as many copies of this ‘unique’ asset as they want. Unlike a famous painting, where a print would be very different from an original, digital copies of proprietary images look exactly the same. Like with commercial licensing, the photographer or graphic designer owns the copyright – the right to reproduce, share, or make derivative works from the original. If you own an NFT, you have the right to sell your ownership, but not to license the image unless the copyright has been transferred. So what’s new? Unlike commercial licensing, NFTs provide people with a way to change ownership. But, other people can still make copies. I suppose the difference is owning an original versus a copy of someone else’s property? This could be likened to owning the Mona Lisa, versus owning an exact replica of the Mona Lisa. So, a lot of NFTs’ value adds up to bragging rights (along with the hefty sums they can re-sell for). What’s the Mona Lisa of NFTs? Mike Winkelmann, the digital artist known as “Beeple,” famously sold his NFT “Everydays: The First 5000 Days” for a cool $69 million at Christie’s in 2021. While no one would call Beeple a modern-day da Vinci, his sale was one of the biggest in NFT history, and one of the reasons these digital assets are so prolific now. Image Credit: OpenSea Since when did intangible art become worth so much? NFTs gained traction rapidly in the last couple of years, but non-material art has been around for a while. There was an interesting development back in 1958 when Yves Klein took a literal approach to capitalize on the growing market value of intangible goods. He entered the New York art scene with a project called The Void , a gallery with literally nothing in it. According to Klein, art can be experienced without intervening materials. To a similar effect, Italian ‘artist’ Salvatore Garau sold an invisible sculpture (air) in 2021 for $22,000, a price jacked up in a bidding war. After going through what was likely a bad case of buyer’s remorse, the unidentified purchaser decided to sue the artist. Like, yeah, man. Of course, digital artwork is not comparable to ‘invisible’ artwork, but they are both distinctly different from traditional art forms in that ownership is not materially verifiable. For Garau’s piece, the only proof of goods exchanged was the bill or sale; in the case of NFTs, it’s a transaction record kept on computers to verify authenticity and ownership. While extreme, this example brings up interesting questions about the definition of art. Does art require materials? Can it be a digital non-fungible asset? Does art even require an artist, or can it be AI-generated and algorithmically produced ? Marketing Immaterial Things Garau’s invisible sculpture shows us that, in practice, art is anything that can be marketed as art. His tactic was to situate art as an experience of interpretation on the individual level, rather than a material form. Therefore, viewers had to ‘use their imagination’ to interpret his nothingness… I guess. NFT and Web 3.0 enthusiasts have been getting a lot of people on board using inventive marketing tactics as well. No doubt, the concept of NFTs is valuable and some seem to be worth investing in. Not only do they provide creatives with a marketplace for their work, but they also allow the artists to set royalties, so the original creator gets a cut when an NFT is re-sold. It makes sense why artists are getting on board. But getting people to buy them is a different story. Visa was one of many big companies to get in on the NFT craze. They purchased CryptoPunk #7610, one NFT from a very popular collection, for $150,000. Granted, that’s not much money for one of the world’s biggest financial giants, but more and more ‘average Js’ are spending a lot of money on digital art. Buyers are split into two groups: i) people who want to collect digital art, and ii) people who are investing in NFTs to make money off what they hope will be an increased market value. The former group certainly does not display digital assets like they would traditional art installations, nor do they purchase NFTs for that reason. Instead, you’re paying for exclusivity. For instance, CryptoPunk is an NFT project of 10,000 characters wearing hats, smoking pipes, etc., that was created by a pixelated character generator. Image Credit: OpenSea It was one of the first NFT projects on the Ethereum blockchain and there are a limited number of them. Ergo, its value skyrocketed, some going for millions of dollars. For the latter group, creators and marketers have smartly (and successfully) positioned NFTs, along with cryptocurrency, blockchain, and other Web 3.0 technologies, as an opportunity to get in on the ‘ground floor’ of something big. This ad by WealthSimple is now widely recognized and a great example of the marketing direction for Web 3.0 technologies. Using NFTs to Foster Brand Loyalty NFTs give brands the unique opportunity to engage with their audiences in a personal and interactive way. Artist popularity accrues by building online communities of supporters or ‘fans.’ When brands create these communities, they foster loyal and lasting audiences – a notoriously difficult to achieve and worthwhile goal for marketers. The problem is that NFTs are high risk and high reward. An NFT might not gain traction at all. Even if it does, many organizations might find that their target audiences aren’t in the ‘early adopters’ NFT and cryptocurrency community. So even if you create something really popular, it won’t drive worthwhile conversions. That said, many bigger companies (the ones willing to potentially lose some money on a risky investment) have successfully leveraged NFTs to bolster brand awareness. Brands like Coachella, Adidas, and Coca-Cola are a few of many. This past year, Coachella offered paying guests an NFT of a flower that bloomed on the Friday of the festival. It was an overall successful campaign. After all, everyone loves product giveaways and freebies are a great way to resonate with consumers. In Adidas’ first foray with Web 3.0, the company sold at least $22 million within several hours after launching a collection of 30,000 “Into the Metaverse” NFTs. Coca-Cola, a company with some of the most iconic and memorable branding out there, launched four collectable NFTs for a charity auction. The ‘loot box’ included a vintage cooler, a bubble jacket, a friendship card that plays off original 1948 artwork used for Coca-Cola trading cards, and a sound visualizer of a coke bottle being opened and a drink being poured over ice. The campaign generated more than $575,000, all of which was donated to Special Olympics International, and loads of brand awareness. Image Credit: OpenSea Final Thoughts It’s hard to tell whether this is a passing fad, or if the world will continue to embrace Web 3.0 technologies. For the time being, NFTs are great business opportunities and an interesting marketing tool that artists and brands can use to their advantage. Granted, not every business has Visa-level money to be spending on NFTs. But making your own could be a relatively affordable, if not enjoyable, way to market your company and build an online community. They’re also an interesting (and slightly confusing) example of the direction marketing practices are moving in a Web 3.0 world. At the very least, it’s something for advertisers to keep their eyes on. Comments Leave A Comment... Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

    "https://www.kiplingmedia.com/pr-101-creative-storytelling-pitches-how-to-write-press-release-for-event": "Creative Pitches | How To Write A Press Release For An Event Brand Brand / Business / Content / PR & Communications PR 101: Creative Storytelling Pitches & How To Write A Press Release For An Event Press release preparation is essential to corporate communications. They can help you generate brand awareness, improve SEO, shape public perception of your company, and share news about business developments. To get your story featured, you need a press release that is timely and targeted. It must also relate to the atmosphere in arts, politics, business, social movements, or other current events. Every brand has a story. All you need to do is find it, share it, and grow your business! Samantha Kroontje March 1, 2023 Table Of Contents Pitching to media: The basics of writing a press release Making a media list When disseminating your release, start with local media and move up to national or international outlets. Making a list of journalists with a demonstrated interest in your story’s topic is a great way to maximize your efforts while pitching. Start by finding articles about similar matters in publications that fit your brand – working from smaller media outlets towards more expansive networks. Be sure to indicate that you know whom you’re writing to (i.e., by mentioning their articles you’ve read about related topics) and why your story fits well with their publication. Always asking: why is this newsworthy today ? You need a compelling hook and an engaging story to rise above the noise of journalists’ inboxes. So, use a pithy, captivating hook right at the start of your release and imitate the headlines used by publications you’re pitching. Of course, editors are looking for a great story, but it’s certainly a bonus if the article is already written for them. Before writing a release, consider why your brand story matters now. Your product may be related to a more significant industry trend, or you can be covered for a feature article or as an expert with a timely opinion. If you’re a part of growing movements or trends, journalists can use your brand to comment on them – win, win! Writing a press release is about imparting relevant facts and weaving in a story. While releases should be impartial and fact-based, it is also vital that they maintain the style and voice that sets good press releases apart from the myriad of others stacking up on journalists’ desks. They should also be concise and direct, excluding all redundant information. Effectively delivering your pitches It can sometimes be challenging to tell a story engagingly while keeping a press release under a page. If there’s too much information to include and you are having trouble getting to the point of the story, an effective strategy may be to employ both in-email pitches along with a “master” press release attached. This strategy is especially effective if your press release strategy involves multiple angles targeted toward different journalists and media outlets. Here, the hook and the engaging writing should be in the email body. Couple that with a master press release that can accompany each unique story angle, and the network will have everything they need to tell your brand story. In that release, include a couple of conscious paragraphs about your organization, details about your product or event, relevant quotes, and any other information the writer may need to tell your story. Writing a press release: Follow the rules of releases The structure of a press release includes a headline, date, location, and note expressing that the story is “for immediate release.” Following these standard practices indicates to your reader that you are well-versed in press release preparation. For instance, most PR professionals attach a “– 30 –” at the end of the body of the writing. Its purpose was to indicate that the story was over, so journalists knew they weren’t missing a page in an age of hard copies and mail. While that is generally not a concern when communicating through email, following the traditional anatomy of a press release tells editors that you are experienced. How To Write A Press Release For An Event Creating Your Own Hook Event-based companies may have an easier time getting picked up for earned media than product-based companies, seeing that events can capitalize on the popularity of found stories (local happenings) in newspapers and magazines. But, throwing your own event/experiential activation, or participating in someone else’s, can be a great way to get in on these found stories while fostering loyalty and conversions amongst customers. Event marketing is a promotional strategy that involves live or online events and face-to-face contact between brands and potential customers. The type of event will depend on your product or service: a beverage company might sponsor a night at a club or throw a party, while a wealth management firm may host a seminar. Events could include sponsorship, pop-up shops, conferences, trade shows, or general product activations in high-traffic areas, like beaches and parks. While these events are all very different, they have one thing in common: they provide value to attendees. Whether it’s learning, recreation, entertainment, or just getting free stuff (a popular bonus in Kipling Media’s experience), your event is benefiting the community… somehow. And people are much more likely to use a product or service when they already know and trust the brand. How Event Marketing can Bolster your Brand Events make it easier to get earned PR. To make an appearance in your local newspaper (without putting money behind it), you need to have or create something newsworthy. AKA, why is X company relevant right now? Couple your event with an engaging press release and email pitch; you’re ready for print. It can foster trust amongst customers. In the age of false advertising and scam sites, people are reticent to try out products with which they aren’t familiar. Event marketing allows companies to provide value to potential customers in real-time. It’s one of the most fun ways to market your brand. Throwing a launch party or sponsoring an event space provides entertainment for your attendees and your team. You can plan your event to drive whatever conversion you need. Whether you need a boost to your email subscribers, social media following, or traditional check-out conversions, throwing or participating in an event is an excellent way to accomplish your goal. Say, for instance, you want to increase your Instagram following. You could offer visitors free products at your pop-up shop if they follow your account or share it with their audience. Or, you could offer a bigger prize to one winner. How To Write A Press Release For An Event: Wrapping Up Over time, you’ll perfect your press release writing skills and foster a network of “friendlies” in the journalism community who will run your stories. In turn, you’ll get lots of brand awareness and shape public perception of your business. Of course, the goal is to get your company news in the large national broadcast networks, but also consider the local, friends-and-family style blogs and papers. The more your story is told, the more discoverable your website becomes on search engines and the more clicks you get. In other words, the more buzz, the better.
