Design & creativity Marketing Culture Our Latest: Accessible marketing 101 (it’s easier than you think) By: Sydney Bokla Zehr is a prominent real-estate developer and construction company based in Kitchener-Waterloo. Their strong focus on partnerships throughout the process results in beautiful and functional new buildings and restorations. The Challenge Zehr’s previous logo had many colours in it. They found it difficult to translate the design to non-digital touchpoints. For example, embroidery on clothing was particularly expensive. Zehr was looking to simplify their visual identity and represent their brand with something bold. At the same time, Zehr was working with a consultant to solidify the company’s mission and vision. The new brand identity needed to reinforce this work. The Work Stryve started by surveying members of the Zehr team to further understand what their brand represents and what differentiates them from the competition. We learned that they wanted a brand that was strong, vibrant, and represented their roots in the Kitchener-Waterloo tech community. We gathered information from their mission and vision work. A few concepts were presented to bring out the letter Z and a feeling of blueprints or a city. Each concept was shown mocked up on various non-digital touchpoints so that Zehr could see how it works on trucks, clothing, documents, and signage. The Results Zehr’s new logo is significantly more vibrant and modern. The negative space creates a Z, while the blocks are of an aerial view of a city block. The large, angled shapes give the logo a feeling of momentum and strength, which are both true of the company. The shapes and angles of the logo have been carried out through many of Zehr’s marketing touchpoints to create a strong visual identity. When it came to creating marketing materials for Zehr’s new brand, utilizing their new bold blue was important for brand recognition for each of their touch points. Additionally, a brand guidelines document was created to maintain the integrity of the Zehr brand both internally and externally facing. Zehr’s attention to detail is visually apparent in their projects, both concept and finished. Utilizing their photography as the main hero, their new site captures the quality and diverse number of projects Zehr has been a part of.

Design & creativity Marketing Culture Our Latest: Accessible marketing 101 (it’s easier than you think) By: Sydney Bokla Our approach to marketing & design drives growth of all kinds. Be agile. Agile methodology in marketing allows teams to be aligned with overall business objectives while staying flexible to emerging opportunities. Shorter planning cycles mean that regular conversations happen about what work you’re doing to contribute to larger goals. More regular check-ins on progress and performance allow you to adapt and adjust instead of setting it and forgetting it. Agile makes marketing faster and better. Iterate & optimize Perfection isn’t the goal because it doesn’t exist. We launch tactics with our best hypothesis, and let the data tell us what we can improve – because there’s always something. Flexible thinking Plans are only as good as the data and circumstances they’re built on. When things change, we have to be open to adapting and adjusting. Organize & prioritize There’s so much we want to accomplish in a given day, week, or year. We have regular conversations about what needs to happen and when so we keep tracking for your goals.

Technology agnostic Suggesting the right tools for your needs is more important than our history with it. Our team can learn tech. Your team can’t get back a bad investment. Ready for feedback Marketing will always be a collaborative discipline with so many stakeholders and subject matter experts. We like to get at the heart of why a certain thing might need to change so that we can be on the same page. Share knowledge If we’ve learned something useful through our work, we want to share it. It makes the marketing discipline stronger and we find better ways to work together. Be human. Respect everyone’s time We all have the same 24 hours in a day and believe that most of it should be spent outside of work. This drives us to use our working time as efficiently as possible so we can experience life and recharge. Connect on an emotional level B2B marketing and client/agency relationships tend to be way too transactional. We want marketing that hits the audience in the feels. We want to know where you’re struggling so we can help out. Make mistakes & learn They happen when you’re willing to take risks and put new ideas on the table. We forgive each other and ourselves, learn from the situation, and keep moving forward. Be your authentic self We know we do our best work when we’re not worried about wearing a corporate mask.

Branding, Design, Digital Advertising, Logo Design, Strategy, Websites FAQs about Strategy What factors do you base your strategy decision making on? The most important factor is your business goals and objectives. Once we have an understanding of what you’re trying to accomplish as an organization, we can build a marketing strategy around that will help accomplish them in the most efficient way. What happens after the strategy is done? It depends on how you want to move forward. We’re strategists but we’re also a full stack team of executionists, reporters, and optimizers. When the strategy is complete, we can get going on executing it, or create a clear and concise hand off doc for you to run with it. What is your approach to setting strategy? We start with where you want to go as a business, then we figure out the best way to get you there, then we break it down into manageable sprints and get to work. How do you collaborate with your clients on strategy? We meet with our clients on a weekly or biweekly basis depending on the needs of the project. We continue to have conversations about priorities and goals throughout the whole of the project to make sure we’re aligned and headed in the right direction. Are B2B marketing strategies different than B2C? Yes, and we know B2B like the back of our hands. But really, every strategy is unique to the company. No strategy is built or executed the same. What kind of research tools do you use? It depends on what we’re looking for. We use a variety of digital tools like SEMrush, Hotjar, and GA4, alongside good ‘ol fashioned interviews and surveys.

Take me there WHAT INTERESTS YOU? Design & creativity Marketing Culture Our Latest: Accessible marketing 101 (it’s easier than you think) By: Sydney Bokla InFlight is an amazing tech company that enables teams to re-imagine the user experience of their enterprise applications without undermining the underlying systems or security. That means InFlight can take that old software you should have ditched years ago, redesign it, and redeploy it to be more efficient, more user-friendly, and more on brand. The same goes for those cumbersome workflows and digital processes you fight through five days a week. The result is increased productivity, employee retention, and employee engagement for InFlight customers. InFlight says there’s no reason why your HRIS, ATS, or other web-based tools can’t be as intuitive as the apps on your smartphone. That's a bold statement and it would be Stryve's job to communicate it with a new site. The Challenge As is the challenge with any new or unique technology, it can be difficult to communicate a previously foreign concept. How do you convince audiences their impossible problem actually has a solution that isn’t too good to be true? To effectively deliver InFlight’s value proposition, we would need to better understand the needs of their target market and align our messaging with those needs. From there, we would need to structure the site to nurture leads and push users to convert on InFlight’s demo and pricing requests. Driven by Analytics We took to GA to assess where users were falling off. Bounce rates were high and the main behaviour flow consisted of a back and forth between the Home page and About page. Clearly, users were missing something. The majority of traffic landing on the Demo page consisted of new users coming directly from organic search results. With the Demo page offering no more than a form, these ice-cold leads were starting at the bottom of the funnel with no prior exposure to InFlight’s content. This is the opposite of lead nurture, so we took this information along with InFlight’s desired conversions and planned a new website structure to influence user flows. InFlight challenged Stryve to create a new website that connected with our target customers to build empathy and credibility. Stryve applied our own product design and user experience principles into the site, created intuitive navigation systems based on customer personas, and designed a front-end that amplifies key information and content. The result is a customer-focused site that clearly communicates our value proposition in the most efficient way possible. We’re already seeing a lift in key metrics and site conversions. In addition to the end results, the process of working with Stryve was great. They field a scrappy team of SMEs that drove the project to completion. Karl Wierzbicki Director of Marketing, InFlight Design We wanted to make InFlight appear more modern and approachable while still keeping their established branding intact. Our first move was to adjust the colour palette, making their orange and blue more vibrant while demoting their navy down to an accent colour. The goal was to come off as less corporate and more friendly while providing a new feeling of energy. The biggest design challenge was keeping things in line with WCAG 2.0 accessibility guidelines while fulfilling our brand objectives. Brighter colours are eye-catching, but they can provide issues with contrast—especially with white text. This meant adjusting colours and font sizes to pass AA standards while still maintaining a clean and professional design. Since InFlight ensures their products are AA accessible, we needed to make sure they ate their own cooking and met the same standard themselves. To give a fresh look to the site and brand, we moved away from generic stock photography and instead presented InFlight’s work as the hero. We created interactive before and after modules to show the InFlight difference and prove their service offering isn’t too good to be true. It was also a decision in line with our goal of keeping the site customer-focused, choosing to show what customers will receive rather than stock models who represent them. Content and Imagery After analyzing competitor sites and buyer personas, we came up with three main use cases and framed them with goal-oriented content. From there, we used industry statistics and statements to empathize and address market pain points before presenting InFlight as the solution. Now, it isn’t enough to just say InFlight is the answer — we needed to show it, too. We used a combination of before and after screenshots and interactive hot-spot images to show InFlight in action. Then, we support our claim with a testimonial or case study before closing the page with a free demo sign-up. User Experience The old InFlight website failed to dictate any sort of navigation path, leading to randomized behaviour flows and a poor return on conversions. While we would rely on content to educate users, it would need to be presented in the right sequence to effectively nurture leads. Apart from having clear buttons and a clean layout, the new site is structured so users will typically get the same story whether they click links throughout the page or work their way across the navigation menu. We’ve done this by breaking the site into sections with inline buttons only linking to proceeding stages in the funnel. This means whether users click the menu or scroll through content, they’ll always be lead down the funnel. Back-End Usability A website is never truly finished. As time passes, there’s always new pages to add, new images to show, and new campaigns to support. For this reason, back-end usability is key to the long-term success of a website. Apart from providing a detailed maintenance document with instructions on creating and editing components, the backend was customized with usability in mind. With each page broken into click-and-drag modules (each with their own set of built-in tips and guides), InFlight can update the site without a developer or any knowledge of code. To further preserve the integrity of the site, we hosted through Pantheon, which utilizes Developer, Test, and Live environments with automatic backups. This means InFlight has three opportunities to preview and confirm changes before going live. If something manages to get by each of the three fail-safes, InFlight can always revert to a site backup from the day before. A website is a major investment, yet the typical company website lasts just 3-4 years . Luckily for InFlight, their new site is equipped with a custom backend and advanced hosting to ensure it outlasts the standard site. On the previous website, maintenance, updates, and building new pages were cumbersome and frustrating tasks that forced me to rely on hacked-together solutions.

Take me there WHAT INTERESTS YOU? Design & creativity Marketing Culture Our Latest: Accessible marketing 101 (it’s easier than you think) By: Sydney Bokla As long as you have a business, your work in marketing is never finished. That's why so many of our long-term client relationships began with a single project and have evolved into multi-year partnerships. As we run more campaigns and employ more strategies, we gain access to more data—data that uncovers opportunities to improve the presence of our clients and the experiences they serve their customers. Projects lead to results. Results lead to insights. Insights lead to opportunities and opportunities lead to projects. Stryve began working with Hybrid Turkeys in 2017, focusing primarily on brand assets and tradeshow collateral. Since then, we've expanded our efforts far beyond design. Through this case study, you'll learn the benefits of a long-term partnership. You'll find out how in the last two years, together with Hybrid Turkeys, we were able to: Increase organic website traffic by 55% Increase the traffic to Hybrid's English resources by 350% Increase the amount of high-engagement users by 27% Identify trends and opportunities through monthly data collection and analysis Improving SEO and engagement with thoughtful UX design As we’ve seen with our own website , content can be a massive driver of traffic. Blogs, resources, and other content archives are packed with valuable keywords that fuel SEO and organic discovery. In 2018, while analyzing Hybrid Turkey’s user behaviour, we discovered the structure of their resource library was limiting the impact it had on SEO. Using an image-based navigation system, the resources site came with an impaired user experience–especially for mobile users. Furthermore, because the library comprised of downloadable PDFs instead of live pages, Hybrid was missing the opportunity to appear in search results for keywords they actually had content for. With that, we proposed rebuilding all of Hybrid’s PDF resources as live pages optimized for priority keywords. Additionally, we would tear down the image-based interface and go with something more modern and user-friendly across all devices. As a result of this work, Hybrid’s traffic has increased 55% since 2018. When looking at users coming from Google Search results to a Hybrid Turkeys resource page, that number goes up by 463%. Hybrid’s flexibility has also improved. While the previous illustration-based layout was fun, it prevented Hybrid from easily adding new categories to the resource library. Now, with a structure that enables front and back-end usability, Hybrid Turkeys is better positioned to add to their resources and keep content organized while expanding their archive. Pivoting to video content in the wake of Covid shutdowns When in-person events shut down in 2020 due to the global pandemic, many businesses saw a major point of consumer engagement disappear overnight. With Hybrid staff often featured at these events as keynote speakers, Hybrid Turkeys would also be losing a forum where they would regularly demonstrate their expertise and capabilities. To make up for this loss, Stryve helped Hybrid Turkeys pivot to video production–investing in webinars, how-to videos, and “ask an expert” interviews. With topics ranging from how to measure egg temperature to discussing the impact of poor nutrition, Hybrid was able to continue living up to its “Partners in Excellence” tagline by repackaging the content and experiences that would otherwise take place at an industry event or on a customer farm. Once we had produced a sizeable video archive on Vimeo and saw consistent positive results in the newsletter and monthly reports, we took the project further by building a video library on Hybrid’s resource site. Since its launch, we’ve seen a 27% increase in web sessions lasting over 3 minutes and an average of 379 views per video. Not every video has been a success, but with ongoing tracking and distribution through the newsletter and social media, we’re able to see which ideas to push forward and which ideas to abandon. While we started by focusing on long-form webinars, we’ve since shifted to bite-sized ‘How-to’ videos–a move that allows us to invest less time into each video and as a result, publish more frequently. With the success of these videos, Hybrid’s ‘How-to’ series has been translated for various markets and teams outside of North America. Identifying trends and opportunities with monthly reporting Choosing to invest in ‘How-to’ videos over other approaches is just one example of how consistent reporting has informed our decision-making. For years, we’ve prepared monthly reports tracking everything from high-level website engagement to the number of views on certain resources. We have over five years of projects to draw from. With these accumulating stats, we’re able to paint a more detailed image of the customer experience and better qualify our strategies. For example, by looking at the monthly traffic over each of the last four years, identifying the high-volume months and low volume months, then looking at pages key to those variances, we found Hybrid’s users were most often visiting the site at the turn of the season–likely to view resources that would inform them on seasonal preparations. Over the years, we’ve seen Hybrid’s mobile engagement inch closer and closer to that of their desktop engagement, furthering the need to consider mobile optimization of downloadable assets. With third-party cookies on their way out, companies will need to rely more and more on their own first-party data to support ideas. With that, it becomes more important than ever to have a trusted and capable agency partner to convert that data into opportunity. Trust and capability don’t just happen–they’re grown over time. Contact Stryve to start building that partnership today.

Design & creativity Marketing Culture Our Latest: Accessible marketing 101 (it’s easier than you think) By: Sydney Bokla The Mission Sentinel Medical Technologies was founded to advance the standard of care through a growing suite of innovative pressure-based monitoring devices that suit a variety of disease states. However, they were struggling to effectively convey the compelling narrative and cost-effectiveness of their TraumaGuard device. Acknowledging the necessity for a more comprehensive and persuasive tool that would resonate with Value Analysis Committees (VAC), Sentinel engaged our expertise in communication design to create a ‘VAC Pack’, a document outlining the clinical and economic benefits of acquiring TraumaGuard for hospitals across America. The Outcome Equipped Sentinel’s team with a thorough document positioning the TraumaGuard System as a compelling solution for hospitals. Enabled Sentinel’s sales team to improve communication with diverse stakeholders during the sales process by providing evidence of product value. Simplified complex product use cases and evidence-based studies to support physicians championing TraumaGuard in their hospitals. The Impact Stryve’s skills in information design, data visualization, storytelling, and graphic design brought to life Sentinel’s VAC Pack, a compelling 50-page document positioning the product’s patient, practitioner, and economic benefits. The Project In healthcare , where resources are limited and the demand for care feels endless , hospitals are hyper-critical of the products they adopt. To get products into a hospital, most medical technology companies will need to pass through a hospital’s Value Analysis Committee (VAC), a multidisciplinary team that’s responsible for approving hospital purchases by analyzing the overall value, cost-effectiveness , and impacts on the quality of care. Despite having an innovative, FDA approved product that’s backed by clinical studies, Sentinel was struggling to effectively communicate with the wide range of VAC members ranging from clinicians and nurses to business admin. The original VAC Pack was a disparate collection of marketing and sales collateral that didn’t tell a cohesive and progressive story. It was particularly challenging for Sentinel to justify the initial unit cost of their product in comparison to alternatives. Recognizing the need for a comprehensive and persuasive document, Sentinel turned to us to craft a solution tailored specifically for engaging VAC members during the sales process. Planning information: getting the facts and understanding our audience To help Sentinel, we needed to understand their product as well as the common objections they received when discussing their product within hospitals. We embarked on a journey of discovery and research , conducting interviews with Sentinel’s team, meticulously gathering information, and aggregating existing materials to understand the intricacies of their product and its value proposition. We proactively tackled any potential objections head on in the VAC Pack by holding workshop sessions with their in-field team who are boots to the ground arming us with insights. With supply chain, clinical, and financial stakeholders conducting value analysis, the document needed to clearly answer their questions from multiple angles. We first aimed to answer the following questions: Who are the members of the V alue Analysis Committee and what are their needs and motivations ? How will the VAC Pack be used? What information do the stakeholders reading the document require? From there, we determined that the VAC Pack needed to include: Product information Clinical evidence Cost analysis Comparative analysis Testimonials Supporting documentation ranging from research articles to studies and certificates Visual aids to support various sections Organizing content: mapping the narrative flow With so much to explain in one document, Sentinel needed a systematic approach to organize the vast array of information required in the VAC Pack. After conducting interviews and gathering information , the next step of the information design process was to create a rough outline of the story. At this stage, we focused on high-level organization of sections and themes. Key points and themes were grouped together, and we focused on crafting a logical progression of the content. Once approved, we went one layer deeper by organizing information within each page. This incremental approach to content architecture provided opportunities to check in regularly with the Sentinel team to ensure the narrative would be persuasive and clear . Crafting compelling copy appealing to VACs Once we had established the story architecture and wireframed the flow , we began drafting copy. We went through several iterations of refining the content . The goal was to ensure we provided clear responses to common questions and objections. It was i ntegral we use language and terminology that resonates with healthcare professionals and administrators while explaining technical complexities without overwhelming jargon. Designing pages, data visualization and diagramming Since medical technology can be highly technical and not all members of VAC committees may be as familiar with clinical workflows or processes, it was imperative to include visual aids within the VAC Pack. For our design approach, we wanted to ensure the document didn’t feel intimidating . We took a clean and clinical approach with chapter – like sections that grouped information into easily digestible parts. We visualized a variety of processes and conditions to make complex ideas easier for reader s to understand . These visualizations included: TraumaGuard set-up and connectors Impact of IAP ( Intra-Abdominal Pressure ) on organs Graphs and measurement data Patient statistics Unique features of product design Tables and comparison charts Overcoming product visualization challenges Given the unique nature of TraumaGuard as a catheter and cable which is placed within the body, we needed to find creative ways to showcase its functionality without being graphic or displaying sensitive body parts. To address this challenge, we created detailed technical line-drawings that depicted the complete system. Additionally, we collaborated with a vendor to produce 3D renders, balancing clarity and visual appeal while maintaining professionalism and sensitivity. Enhanced clarity for VACs By transforming Sentinel’s VAC Pack, we effectively showcased the TraumaGuard System’s functionality and enhanced Sentinel’s communication with diverse stakeholders, empowering their sales team and positioning the TraumaGuard System as a compelling solution for hospitals.
