Více o muzeu Více o KVH Náchod Historie opevnění Soboty a letní prázdniny jsou jistota Otevřeno máme od 10:00 do 18:00 hodin (poslední prohlídka na Březince začíná v 17:15 hod.) v těchto dnech: od 1. května do 30. září každou sobotu v červenci a srpnu denně včetně pondělí o státních svátcích 1. a 8. května, 28. září a 28. října v jiných termínech po předchozí dohodě na e-mailu musemum(a)brezinka.cz Objektem Březinka Vás provede zkušený průvodce, který Vám vysvětlí, jak objekt fungoval. Prohlídka trvá 45 až 60 minut. Návštěvníci jsou povinni se řídit pokyny průvodce a nevzdalovat se od skupiny. U školních výletů je nutná přítomnost dozírajících učitelů, na každých započatých 15 dětí musí být jeden dozor. Počet osob ve skupině nesmí přesáhnout 15 osob (včetně dětí), u početnějších skupin se vstupuje do objektu v 15ti členných skupinkách v časových intervalech, které jsou závislé na počtu přítomných průvodců. Expozice v objektech Voda a Lom si můžete problédnout sami, protože prohlídka je zde individuální. Mimo návštěvní dny se na našich objektech provádí nutná údržba expozic. Přesto se i při předem neohlášené návštěvě nevzdávejte a zkuste o prohlídku požádat na jednom z pevnostních objektů N-S 82 Březinka nebo N-S 81 Lom. Stačí zazvonit u vchodu nebo zatelefonovat na 603 776 961, hlavně o víkendech máte velkou šanci uspět. Pokud prohlídce nebudou bránit nějaké objektivní příčiny (např. prováděné nátěry), rádi Vás pevnostními objekty provedeme. Podrobnosti o návštěvní době Najít naše objekty je snadné Příjezd ke srubu „Voda“ je jednoduchý: z Hradce Králové po dálnici D11 a silnici I/33 směr Náchod, v Náchodě dále směr Wrocław.

Bardzo dużo ciekawych informacji przekazanych na wystawach oraz przez przewodników, szczególnie pana Piotra. Polecam! Patrick Kania 5 dni temu Phenomenal place. Both the inside and open air exhibits are fantastic. Ticket price is very fair and I was fortunate to visit at a slow time so I practically had the place to myself. the vehicles are clearly well taken care of and maintained. The trucks and less robust things are under an awning to protect them and the rest is arranged very well to walk around and enjoy it all. Take your time especially with the inside exhibits, since there is an amazing mix of relics that are displayed as found as well as incredible restored items.

Günter Oestreicher 6 dni temu Tom Bush tydzień temu Dużo eksponatów gabarytowych takich jak czogi i mase innych polecam 🙂 kasiakropka371 3 miesiące temu Muzeum w Poznaniu jest jednym z najlepiej wyposażonych w czołgi i pojazdy wojskowe. Ilość zgromadzonych wozów pancernych jest imponująca. Zostały one umieszczone w 4 hangarach oraz kilka z nich na zewnątrz. Podczas naszego zwiedzania odbywały się małe pokazy i można było się przejechać samochodem wojskowym i postrzelać. Na zwiedzanie, dla tych co lubią sprzęty wojskowe, możecie przeznaczyć z 2 godziny. Zwiedzać można z lektorem tzn ze słuchawkami i są dwie opcje do wyboru, dłuższa bardziej szczegółowa i druga z mniejszą ilością materiału dla początkujących. Znajdziecie tam również czołg Rudy który ""grał"" w Czterech Pancernych. Serdecznie polecam John B miesiąc temu Fantastyczne miejsce dla miłośników ciężkich militariów. 4 hale pełne eksponatów które można oglądać godzinami. Niektóre czołgi zbyt gęsto ustawione i nie da się podejść z każdej strony ale i tak warto. Tom S miesiąc temu Świetne miejsce dla miłośników historii i militariów. Ogromna kolekcja czołgów i pojazdów pancernych, wiele unikatowych eksponatów w doskonałym stanie. Muzeum nowoczesne, dobrze zorganizowane, z dużym parkingiem i przyjazną obsługą. Przewodnicy to prawdziwi pasjonaci, którzy potrafią opowiadać z ogromnym zaangażowaniem. Zdecydowanie warto odwiedzić. Krzysztof Labecki 5 miesięcy temu Muzeum Broni Pancernej w Poznaniu to miejsce, które naprawdę robi wrażenie! Zgromadzono tu imponującą kolekcję pojazdów pancernych, w tym unikatowe niemieckie eksponaty z okresu II wojny światowej, takie jak Sturmgeschütz IV – jedyny kompletny egzemplarz tego działa samobieżnego na świecie. Nie sposób nie wspomnieć o słynnym “Rudym 102” – czołgu T-34/85, który zagrał w kultowym serialu “Czterej pancerni i pies” . ￼ To miejsce nie tylko prezentuje historię, ale ją ożywia. Pasja i zaangażowanie pracowników muzeum sprawiają, że każda wizyta staje się niezapomnianym doświadczeniem. Dbałość o detale i troska o pamięć historyczną są tu naprawdę godne podziwu. Serdecznie polecam to muzeum wszystkim, którzy chcą poczuć ducha historii i zobaczyć z bliska imponujące maszyny, które kiedyś brały udział w najważniejszych wydarzeniach XX wieku.

Można też dojechać komunikacją miejską. Radek Bernacki 4 miesiące temu Będąc w Poznaniu zdecydowanie warto odwiedzić to miejsce.

WIĘCEJ Muzeum Techniki Wojskowej „Gryf” otwarte jest od środy do niedzieli w godz. 10:00 – 17:00 (kasa biletowa do godziny 15:00) Muzeum Techniki Wojskowej Gryf zostało założone w kwietniu 2013 roku przez Mariana Koteckiego. Od maja 2015 r. siedzibą placówki jest Dąbrówka k. Wejherowa. Obecnie w ekspozycji można zobaczyć ponad 100 pojazdów wojskowych, samochodów zabytkowych, dział i rakiet, a także broń, umundurowanie i wyposażenie wojskowe. Wielką atrakcją jest wystawa saperska z największymi w Polsce zbiorami bomb, min, granatów, amunicji artyleryjskiej oraz wyposażenia saperskiego. Ideą przewodnią Muzeum Techniki Wojskowej GRYF jest prezentacja eksponatów w sposób żywy i dynamiczny poprzez interakcję ze zwiedzającymi i publicznością podczas imprez. Większość eksponatów jest sprawna technicznie, można je uruchomić i zobaczyć w akcji. Muzeum aktywnie uczestniczy w organizacji plenerowych widowisk historycznych, zarówno w siedzibie muzeum w Dąbrówce i poza nią, a także w realizacjach historycznych filmów fabularnych i dokumentalnych. Można było zobaczyć nas w “akcji” w takich filmach jak “Miasto 44”, “Kamerdyner”, serial “Czas Honoru – Powstanie”, czy w produkcjach Bogusława Wołoszańskiego. Ściśle współpracujemy z grupami rekonstrukcji historycznej, których odpowiednio umundurowani członkowie stanowią załogi pojazdów, bądź zajmują się obsługą innych eksponatów podczas prezentacji. Zajmujemy się także organizacją imprez o charakterze edukacyjnym i popularyzującym historię. Naszą działalność regulują: ustawa o muzeach, ustawa o organizowaniu i prowadzeniu działalności kulturalnej oraz własny statut. Muzeum podlega Ministrowi Kultury i Dziedzictwa Narodowego.

V současné době ji tvoří více než 700 historických tanků, kanonů, motocyklů, obrněných, nákladních a osobních vojenských vozidel, raketová technika, spojovací a ženijní prostředky a logistický materiál pocházející z období od roku 1890 až do současnosti. Sbírky jsou široké veřejnosti prezentovány v deseti halách, pod šesti přístřešky a na volném prostranství. Rozsahem a složením svých sbírek, v nichž je zastoupen nejeden světový unikát, se toto muzeum řadí mezi nejvýznamnější evropské instituce svého druhu. Unikátní je zejména sbírka československých vojenských dopravních prostředků - tanků, motocyklů, nákladních a velitelských automobilů - z období let 1918–1939 a kolekce kanonů systému Škoda. Z období studené války patří mezi jedinečné exponáty raketová technika a také tanky - jak z výzbroje Varšavské smlouvy, tak z výzbroje NATO. Expozičním pojetím se muzeum hlásí k moderním trendům prezentace sbírek technické povahy. Každoroční obměna i poutavé představování exponátů v pohybu a postupné zdokonalování výstavních prostor muzea tak návštěvníkům umožňuje lépe nahlédnout do tajů nejen čs. historické vojenské techniky. V rámci jarního zahájení výstavní sezony probíhají každoročně v muzejní aréně akce s prezentací historické techniky v pohybu. Největší událostí roku bývají Tankové dny, které se konají vždy poslední sobotu na konci prázdnin. Prohlédněte si fotogalerii z expozic.

Unikátní je zejména sbírka československých vojenských dopravních prostředků - tanků, motocyklů, nákladních a velitelských automobilů - z období let 1918–1939 a kolekce kanonů systému Škoda. Z období studené války patří mezi jedinečné exponáty raketová technika a také tanky - jak z výzbroje Varšavské smlouvy, tak z výzbroje NATO. Expozičním pojetím se muzeum hlásí k moderním trendům prezentace sbírek technické povahy. Každoroční obměna i poutavé představování exponátů v pohybu a postupné zdokonalování výstavních prostor muzea tak návštěvníkům umožňuje lépe nahlédnout do tajů nejen čs. historické vojenské techniky. V rámci jarního zahájení výstavní sezony probíhají každoročně v muzejní aréně akce s prezentací historické techniky v pohybu. Největší událostí roku bývají Tankové dny, které se konají vždy poslední sobotu na konci prázdnin. Prohlédněte si fotogalerii z expozic.

Cyrila a Metoděje. Zde se 21 nocí ukrývalo sedm parašutistů po atentátu na Reinharda Heydricha, kteří zde 18. června 1942 svedli svůj poslední boj. V místnosti před kryptou se nachází expozice věnovaná operaci Anthropoid. Původně ""Národní památník obětí heydrichiády - místo smíření"" při katedrálním chrámu sv. Cyrila a Metoděje založili v roce 1995 manželé Jaroslav a Eva Šuvarští. V roce 2017 převzal již ""Národní památník hrdinů heydrichiády"" do své správy Vojenský historický ústav Praha. Současná expozice instalovaná na 80. výročí událostí 18. června 2022 sleduje dějinný vývoj od Mnichovské dohody, přes vznik protektorátu Čechy a Morava, nástup Reinharda Heydricha k moci, k přípravám a provedení operace Anthropoid, až k boji v kostele a kryptě sv. Cyrila a Metoděje. Pozornost je také věnována sokolským odbojářům a členům pravoslavné církve, jež parašutistům aktivně pomáhali. Expozice je v českém a anglickém jazyce a doplňují ji nejen unikátní sbírkové předměty, ale také dobové audiovize. Krypta má pietní charakter a uzavírá celou expozici. Nacházejí se v ní busty sedmi československých vojáků s jejich životopisy. Autorem bust je akad. soch. Milan Benda. Vlastníkem památníku je Magistrát hl. m. Prahy, správu vykonává Vojenský historický ústav Praha. Současná expozice byla otevřena na 80. výročí událostí 18. června 2022.

Některé hry jsem neviděla roky. Můj devítiletý synovec se tu vyřádil. Je to tu vhodné k odložení tatínků s dětmi, když chtějí maminky v klidu nakupovat. Určitě to tu stojí za návštěvu. Žanet ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Parádní místo, obsluha velmi milá a hry velmi rozmanité. Oceňují, že můžete opustit areál a vrátit se později během dne, třeba když si jdete na pití nebo na čerstvý vzduch.

V celÃ©m muzeu je bezbariÃ©rovÃ½ pÅÃ­stup . ZbranÄ, zbroj, a vÃ½zbroj ÄlovÄka doprovÃ¡zÃ­ od nepamÄti. U Å¾ v dobÄ kamennÃ© ÄlovÄk potÅeboval ke svÃ© loveckÃ© Äinnosti zbranÄ. Byly to sice primitivnÃ­ zbranÄ, ale jak Å¡el Äas, tak jako vÅ¡echno i zbranÄ byly zdokonalovÃ¡ny. VelkÃ½m zlomem v historii zbranÃ­, bylo obdobÃ­ sedmÃ©ho aÅ¾ devÃ¡tÃ©ho stoletÃ­, kdy byl v ÄÃ­nÄ vynalezen ÄernÃ½ stÅelnÃ½ prach. UÅ¾ ve tÅinÃ¡ctÃ©m stoletÃ­ pronikl tento vynÃ¡lez do Evropy. N etrvalo dlouho a na evropskÃ©m kontinentÄ se rozrostla vÃ½roba stÅelnÃ½ch zbranÃ­. To vedlo k postupnÃ©mu zÃ¡niku rytÃ­ÅÅ¯, jako stÅedovÄkÃ½ch bojovnÃ­kÅ¯. Ve velkÃ©m se palnÃ© zbranÄ zaÄali pouÅ¾Ã­vat aÅ¾ v patnÃ¡ctÃ©m stoletÃ­ a to husity. DalÅ¡Ã­m velkÃ½m zlomem v historii byl rok 1887 - Alfred Nobel vynalezl a nechal jsi patentovat bezdÃ½mnÃ½ stÅelnÃ½ prach, kterÃ½ je dodnes pouÅ¾Ã­vÃ¡n ve vÄtÅ¡inÄ palnÃ½ch zbranÃ­ch.

V dalÅ¡Ã­ ÄÃ¡sti vidÃ­me uniformy a artefakty rakousko - uherskÃ© armÃ¡dy. Rakousko - Uhersko byl stÃ¡tnÃ­ Ãºtvar, kterÃ½ vznikl roku 1867 a zanikl roku 1918. BÄhem tohoto obdobÃ­, kterÃ©mu vlÃ¡dl cÃ­saÅ FrantiÅ¡ek Josef I, doÅ¡lo k mnoha zÃ¡sadnÃ­m politickÃ½m udÃ¡lostech. Roku 1914, byl v Sarajevu spÃ¡chÃ¡n atentÃ¡t na nÃ¡slednÃ­ka Rakousko uherskÃ©ho trÅ¯nu FrantiÅ¡ka Ferdinanda d'Este a mÄsÃ­c nato byla vyhlÃ¡Å¡ena vÃ¡lka Srbsku a zanedlouho nato byla do prvnÃ­ svÄtovÃ© vÃ¡lky vtaÅ¾ena celÃ¡ Evropa. PrvnÃ­ svÄtovÃ¡ vÃ¡lka skonÄila roku 1918. Bilance ztrÃ¡t byla do tÃ© doby nevÃ­danÃ¡, deset miliÃ³nÅ¯ mrtvÃ½ch a dalÅ¡Ã­ch dvanÃ¡ct miliÃ³nÅ¯ zranÄnÃ½ch. Po porÃ¡Å¾ce NÄmecka, muselo NÄmecko na zÃ¡kladÄ VersailleskÃ© mÃ­rovÃ© smlouvy, platit obrovskÃ© vÃ¡leÄnÃ© reparace vÃ­tÄznÃ½m stÃ¡tÅ¯m a navÃ­c bylo velmi omezeno ve vyzbrojovÃ¡nÃ­ armÃ¡dy a to se nezadrÅ¾itelnÄ blÃ­Å¾ila ekonomickÃ¡ krize, kterÃ¡ pÅerostla v hospodÃ¡Åskou.Tuto situaci dokÃ¡zal bravurnÄ vyuÅ¾Ã­t Adolf Hitler, kterÃ½ svÃ½mi nÃ¡zory o nÃ¡rodnÃ­m socializmu dokÃ¡zal poblouznit vÄtÅ¡inu nÄmeckÃ©ho nÃ¡roda a rozpoutal druhou svÄtovou vÃ¡lku, kterÃ¡ zaÄala napadenÃ­m Polska prvnÃ­ho zÃ¡ÅÃ­ 1939.

Výstava vás zavede do světa mladých designérů z ateliéru Design světelných objektů, kteří s odvahou a kreativitou překračují hranice tradičního svícení. Jejich díla – od funkčních stojanových svítidel po volné světelné instalace – propojují sklo, kov a světlo v harmonii, která nejen oslní, ale i inspiruje. Každý objekt je důkazem toho, že i s minimální spotřebou energie lze vytvořit zářivý zážitek. Výstava využívá jedinečnou atmosféru podzemního sálu Gorlice, kde světelné instalace mladých tvůrců vedou dialog s originály barokních soch z Karlova mostu.

Nejbližší návštěvní den je pátek 1.5.2026 Otevřeno máme od 10 do 18 hodin (poslední prohlídka na Březince je v 17:15 hod). Více informací Kudy k nám Nejjednodušší cesta je k objektu Voda, který se nachází u dětského hřiště v Náchodě-Bělovsi poblíž obchodního domu Kaufland. Březinku si budete muset vyšlápnout pěšky. Odměnou Vám bude jeden k nejlépe zrekonstruovaných pevnostních objektů, ale také nádherná příroda v jeho okolí. Více informací Co je nového Na BŘEZINCE byla osazena replika kulometné lafety DZ-2 pro těžký kulomet - pro znalce opevnění se jedná o velmi zajímavý exponát. V expozici v objektu VODA byla doplněna sbírka modelů obrněné techniky. V expozici v objektu LOM jsme pro vás připravili nové informační panely o lehkém opevnění a vývoji evropských fortifikací. Více informací Objekt ""BŘEZINKA"" Objekt je zcela zrekonstruován do stavu z roku 1938 včetně veškeré výzbroje a vnitřního vybavení. Během prohlídky si vytvoříte názornou představu, jak měl vypadat pěchotní srub připravený k boji. Prohlídky probíhají s průvodcem. N-S 82 BŘEZINKA Objekt ""VODA"" V objektu je expozice věnovaná historii československé armády v letech 1918 až 1945. Můžete zde shlédnout zajímavý dokumetární film o armádě první republiky Prohlídka je individuální, bez průvodce. N-S 84 VODA Objekt ""LOM"" V objektu je expozice věnovaná čs. opevnění, je zde možné zakoupit odbornou literaturu, upomínkové předměty a drobné občerstvení. Část objektu slouží jako zázemí pro členy KVH. Prohlídka je individuální, bez průvodce. N-S 81 LOM Kdo jsme a co je naším cílem? Klub vojenské historie Náchod je neziskovou organizací sdružující zájemce o vojenskou historii. V prostoru naučné stezky Běloves – Dobrošov realizujeme svůj projekt ""Běloveský pevnostní skanzen"", který představuje ucelenou koncepci péče o objekty československého opevnění z let 1935-38. Vstupní branou do skanzenu je bezbariérový pěchotní srub N-S 84 Voda v Náchodě-Bělovsi, kde je vystavena unikátní sbírka mapující historii československé armády první republiky i boj za svobodu během první a druhé světové války. Srdcem projektu je objekt těžkého opevnění N-S 82 Březinka , který má návštěvníky co nejnázorněji seznámit s technickou dokonalostí a jednotlivými funkcemi pěchotního srubu, nejdůležitějšího prvku pevností linie. Objekt je plně zrekonstruovaný do původní podoby z roku 1938 včetně veškerého vybavení a zbraní. Prohlídku pěchotního srubu N-S 82 Březinka doplňuje expozice o československém opevnění v sousedním objektu N-S 81 Lom . Více o muzeu Více o KVH Náchod Historie opevnění Soboty a letní prázdniny jsou jistota Otevřeno máme od 10:00 do 18:00 hodin (poslední prohlídka na Březince začíná v 17:15 hod.) v těchto dnech: od 1. května do 30. září každou sobotu v červenci a srpnu denně včetně pondělí o státních svátcích 1. a 8. května, 28. září a 28. října v jiných termínech po předchozí dohodě na e-mailu musemum(a)brezinka.cz Objektem Březinka Vás provede zkušený průvodce, který Vám vysvětlí, jak objekt fungoval. Prohlídka trvá 45 až 60 minut. Návštěvníci jsou povinni se řídit pokyny průvodce a nevzdalovat se od skupiny. U školních výletů je nutná přítomnost dozírajících učitelů, na každých započatých 15 dětí musí být jeden dozor. Počet osob ve skupině nesmí přesáhnout 15 osob (včetně dětí), u početnějších skupin se vstupuje do objektu v 15ti členných skupinkách v časových intervalech, které jsou závislé na počtu přítomných průvodců. Expozice v objektech Voda a Lom si můžete problédnout sami, protože prohlídka je zde individuální. Mimo návštěvní dny se na našich objektech provádí nutná údržba expozic. Přesto se i při předem neohlášené návštěvě nevzdávejte a zkuste o prohlídku požádat na jednom z pevnostních objektů N-S 82 Březinka nebo N-S 81 Lom. Stačí zazvonit u vchodu nebo zatelefonovat na 603 776 961, hlavně o víkendech máte velkou šanci uspět. Pokud prohlídce nebudou bránit nějaké objektivní příčiny (např. prováděné nátěry), rádi Vás pevnostními objekty provedeme. Podrobnosti o návštěvní době Najít naše objekty je snadné Příjezd ke srubu „Voda“ je jednoduchý: z Hradce Králové po dálnici D11 a silnici I/33 směr Náchod, v Náchodě dále směr Wrocław. Na konci města, asi 1,5 km za druhým kruhovým objezdem, je potřeba na třetím kruhovém objezdu (před supermarketem Kaufland) odbočit doprava. Nedaleko objektu je také autobusová zastávka „Náchod-Běloves, Kaufland“. Od pěchotního srubu Voda vede naučná stezka spojující všechny objekty Běloveského pevnostního skanzenu.

I tak si naši členové připomněli výročí mobilizace čs. branné moci. Naše KVH se účastnila u našich kolegů společné vojenské akce pro veřejnost, bohužel se tato akce nemohla konat u opevnění v Opavě, tak alespoň jak to dovolily podmínky v Polsku u našich kolegů. Rovněž jsme se sami účastnili soutěže ve střelbě a nočního vojenského pochodu, který měl za úkol nás seznámit s dovednostmi ženijních jednotek Polské armády, která rovněž na akci dorazila. Návštěvnost nejen místních obyvatel byla značná. Snad se příští rok povede tuto akci zorganizovat u nás v Opavě. Vážení přátelé, srdečně Vás zveme na společné setkání Klubu vojenské historie Kateřinky se spřáteleným klubem v Polsku, nedaleko státní hranice. Všichni jste srdečně zváni.","Klub vojenské historie Kateřinky z. s. is a military history organization that actively participates in public events and reenactments to commemorate historical military events, particularly focusing on the Czech military history.

Celem wystawy jest przybliżenie zwiedzającym jednej z największych tajemnic PRL. Jej tytuł został bezpośrednio zaczerpnięty z hasła upowszechnianego w czasach świetności Układu Warszawskiego. Hasła dość przewrotnego i groźnego zarazem, przecież broń jądrowa nie budziła wcale poczucia bezpieczeństwa i pokoju, a wręcz przeciwnie. Na ekspozycji będzie można zobaczyć fotografie byłych magazynów broni jądrowej, przedmioty związane z pobytem Wojsk Radzieckich w Polsce, a także sprzęt do rozpoznawania skażenia radioaktywnego i środki ochrony osobistej. Kuratorzy wystawy: Konrad Raubo, Paweł Pochocki Wsparcie merytoryczne - dr Grzegorz Kiarszys autor książki ""Atomowi żołnierze wolności. Archeologia magazynów broni jądrowej w Polsce"" oraz Paweł Urbaniak. Wystawę będzie można oglądać do 7 maja 2023 roku.

Koszarach Kantonistów, zbudowanych w latach 1826-1828, oraz w pochodzących z lat 1825-1826 Stajniach Kubickiego. Muzeum zajmuje się popularyzacją wiedzy związanej z narodową tradycją łowiectwa i jeździectwa, hodowlą koni na ziemiach polskich, a także tematyką przyrodniczą. Zwiedzający oglądać tu mogą wystawy stałe i czasowe. W Koszarach Kantonistów na ekspozycjach stałych prezentowane są: polski salon myśliwski z XIX-XX w. , zwierzęta leśne , ptaki oraz trofea egzotyczne . W Stajniach Kubickiego , wyremontowanych w latach 2019-2021, mieszczą się dwie wystawy stałe: Powozownia im. Zbigniewa Prus-Niewiadomskiego i Królewska Manufaktura Tkacka . INFORMACJA O MUZEUM ŁOWIECTWA I JEŹDZIECTWA W TEKŚCIE ŁATWYM DO CZYTANIA (ETR) - (PILK PDF - FORMAT 1,94 MB) Historia Muzeum Łowiectwa i Jeździectwa Pomysł utworzenia muzeum łowieckiego zrodził się w latach 70. XX wieku. Po rozmowach z Polskim Związkiem Łowieckim ówczesny dyrektor warszawskiego Muzeum Narodowego, prof. Stanisław Lorentz, zaproponował lokalizację placówki na terenie Łazienek Królewskich, zwanych niegdyś Zwierzyńcem. Na siedzibę wybrano Koszary Kantonistów . W dokumentach i publikacjach poświęconych Łazienkom Królewskim spotkać można również inne nazwy tego obiektu: Koszary Inwalidów czy Domek Ogrodnika. Jednopiętrowy budynek, na planie prostokąta, zbudowany został w latach 1826-1828 w południowej części folwarku łazienkowskiego. Przypuszcza się, że autorem projektu architektonicznego był Wilhelm Henryk Minter, budowniczy usytuowanych w pobliżu, a dziś już nie istniejących, koszar huzarów, ułanów i kirasjerów. W 1982 r. połączono dwie inicjatywy: powołania Muzeum Łowiectwa (zespół działający od 1977 r. pod kierunkiem artysty plastyka Tomasza Konarskiego) i Muzeum Jeździectwa (zespół pragnący utworzyć Muzeum Konia). 1 lipca 1983 r. powstała jedna placówka - Muzeum Łowiectwa i Jeździectwa. Ekspozycja hipologiczna miała zostać ulokowana w Stajniach Kubickiego , zwanych również Podkową, których część (jedno skrzydło) Muzeum uzyskało dopiero w 1995 r. Stajnie wybudowano w latach 1825-1826 na terenie folwarku, w miejscu drewnianych. Jakub Kubicki zaprojektował je na planie podkowy, z wyższą jednopiętrową częścią środkową. Znalazły się tam mieszkania dla służby, w parterowych skrzydłach przylegających do korpusu mieściły się stajnie, w bocznych wozownie. Pierwsza stała wystawa muzealna pt. ""Wiosna, lato, jesień, zima"" otwarta została w Koszarach Kantonistów w 1985 r. Ekspozycja ukazywała w atrakcyjnej formie plastycznej ptaki i ssaki polskich lasów i pól. W 1986 r. udostępniono zwiedzającym kolejną ekspozycję - ""Nie tylko o myślistwie"" (prezentowaną do 1992 r. w salach łazienkowskiej Podchorążówki). W pierwszej sali umieszczono dzieła sztuki oraz kolekcje broni i akcesoriów myśliwskich, w drugiej - główną grupę eksponatów stanowiły trofea egzotyczne, przekazane w darze przez Romana Huberta Hupałowskiego, w trzeciej - zbiory hipologiczne. W Koszarach Kantonistów wyeksponowano też ""Historie łowiectwa od pradziejów do czasów Jana III Sobieskiego"". Ze względu na swój profil - połączenie problematyki łowieckiej i jeździeckiej, co jest historycznie uzasadnione - Muzeum stanowi unikat nie tylko w skali krajowej, lecz także europejskiej. Posiada ponad 10 tysięcy eksponatów, z których wiele ma znaczną wartość poznawczą i materialną.

Archeologická expedice do Wad Ben Naga V roce 2009 zahájilo Národní muzeum výzkumy na archeologické lokalitě Wad Ben Naga, nacházející se přibližně 130 km severovýchodně od súdánského hlavního města Chartúmu. Předmětem výzkum je starověké sídliště z dob tzv. Merojského království (asi 300 př. n. l. – 350 n. l.), které svůj největší rozkvět zažilo za vlády krále Natakamaniho a královny Amanitore (1. stol. př. n. l.). Egyptské mumie V roce 2009 byl v Náprstkově muzeu asijských, afrických a amerických kultur zahájen systematický výzkum staroegyptských mumií. Jeho cílem bylo vyšetřit veškerý staroegyptský mumifikovaný materiál ve veřejných sbírkách české republiky pomocí moderních radiologických metod. Vědecký tým sestávající z egyptologů, antropologů a lékařů učinil zásadní poznatky, které jsou zveřejňovány v rámci řady publikací Atlas of Egyptian Mummies in the Czech Collections. Dér el-Medína a Jaroslav Černý Součástí podsbírky pravěku a starověku Předního východu a Afriky je také rozsáhlý soubor pocházející z francouzských výzkumů v Dér el-Medíně, vesnici královských řemeslníků, nebo souvisí s osobností Jaroslava Černého (1898–1970), který se na francouzských výzkumech v Dér el-Medíně podílel. Cílem výzkumu je komplexní publikace těchto sbírek, včetně jejich interpretace. Výzkum se zaměřuje především na soubor hieratických ostrak a předmětů pocházejících z tzv. Východního pohřebiště v Dér el-Medíně. Materiální kultura dynastie Čching (1644–1911) Náprstkovo muzeum uchovává více jak tisíc oděvů, oděvních doplňků, šperků a předmětů drobného uměleckého řemesla z konce dynastie Čching v Číně, a dále více jak tisíc maleb, tisků a fotografií, které dokumentují život v této době. Cílem výzkumu je odborné a vědecké zpracování této sbírky. Tibetský buddhismus v Mongolsku Sbírky přibližně tří tisíc předmětů tibetského buddhismu včetně malby, plastik a rituálních předmětů byly získány nejen v Tibetu a v Číně, ale především v Mongolsku. Cílem výzkumu je vedle zhodnocení sběratelské činnosti původců sbírek též odborný popis a interpretace sbírkového fondu, zejména náboženské malby. Kovy z zemích Blízkého východu, Indie a Indonésie Umělecké řemeslo v kovu, kovotepectví a kovolijectví, byly v zemích Blízkého východu, Indie a Indonésie dovedeny k vysoké dokonalosti ve kvalitě materiálů i způsobu jejich zpracování. Sbírky Náprstkova muzea zahrnují rozsáhlou sbírku kovových nádob užitkového i dekorativního charakteru, širokou škálu šperků a ozdob na oděv i hlavu, a pestrou sbírku zbraní, především chladných. Předmětem vědeckého zkoumání a zpracování těchto bohatých fondů je určení těchto předmětů, jejich zhodnocení v kontextu sběratelských aktivit jejich původních majitelů a jejich zařazení do širšího kontextu světových sbírek a dějin uměleckých řemesel daného regionu. Milan Stuchlík a Mapuche Náprstkovo muzeum vlastní obsáhlou sbírku materiální kultury etnické skupiny Mapuche obývající střední část jižního Chile a jihozápadní Argentinu, jež muzeum získalo soustavnou činností Milana Stuchlíka. Jeho osobnosti a mapuchské sbírce bude věnována vědecká monografie, která se právě připravuje. Milan Stuchlík byl význačný český antropolog, sběratel umění chilských indiánu etnické skupiny Mapuche a profesor antropologie na univerzitě v Cambridge a v Belfastu, jenž zemřel v pouhých 44 letech v severoirském Belfastu. Monografie bude věnována životu a odkazu tohoto českého vědce, od roku 1968 pobývajícího v emigraci - nejprve v Chile a později ve Spojeném království. Životopisné údaje budou čerpat z unikátní pozůstalosti poskytnuté jeho manželkou Jarkou Stuchlíkovou včetně deníkových zápisků a fotografií z výzkumných pobytů mezi Mapuchy. Kniha se bude podrobně zabývat také sbírkou mapuchské kultury Náprstkova muzea pocházející právě ze sběratelských aktivit Milana Stuchlíka. Ve sbírce nalezneme keramické nádoby, kuchařské náčiní a další vybavení tradiční domácnosti, sportovní potřeby, nosítka na děti, masky, tkaniny, šperky i zbraně. V roce 1826 zakoupili staropražský dům U Halánků s pivovarem a vinopalnou manželé Fingerhutovi, aby jej pak jejich mladší syn Vojtěch za několik let proslavil doslova po celém světě. Vojta Náprstek založil muzeum v roce 1873 jako České průmyslové muzeum a stal se známým mecenášem a propagátorem nových myšlenek a technologií. Jeho láska k orientálním vědám a podpora cestovatelů jako Emila Holuba, Josefa Kořenského, Enriqua Stanko Vráze a dalších, mu přinesla početné dary, které nakonec změnily charakter muzea z průmyslového na národopisné. Po roce 1944 došlo k připojení k Národnímu muzeu a rozdělení sbírek tak, aby se orientovaly pouze na mimoevropská etnika a jejich kultury. I dnes má muzeum své mecenáše a dárce, kteří tak navazují na Náprstkův odkaz a obohacují jeho sbírkový fond. Pomáhají nejen posouvat hranice poznání, ale zároveň udržují místo výjimečného setkávání s neopakovatelným geniem loci. Sbírky muzea jsou nesmírně bohaté a jen velmi malá část je vystavena. V pražském domě U Halánků je návštěvníkům k dispozici rovněž veřejná knihovna, která nenabízí jen knihy a periodika, ale i další kolekce, z nichž mnohé založil již Vojta Náprstek. Je to sbírka historických fotografií, stereoskopických obrázků, dobové grafiky či výstřižkových knih. K dispozici jsou rovněž rozsáhlé archivy rodiny Náprstkovy, cestovatelů a Čechů žijících v zahraničí. Muzeum se snaží všechny své sbírky postupně zveřejňovat a zpřístupňovat. Kromě tematických výstav z vlastních sbírek, organizuje muzeum exkluzivní zahraniční výstavy ve spolupráci se zahraničními institucemi. Nabídka pro návštěvníky je oživena množstvím doprovodných programů, mezi které patří komentované prohlídky, přednášky, tvůrčí dílny či festivaly, kde je možné poznávat mimoevropské kultury všemi smysly. Malebné nádvoří slouží nejen jako veřejný prostor pro oddech návštěvníků, ale i pro pořádání společenských akcí.

Československá armáda samozřejmě disponovala i technikou vyrobenou v zahraničí, ale především armáda první republiky kladla důraz na domácí výrobu. Muzeum vojenské historie a Staroměstska má k dispozici několik expozic s opravdu unikátními a tedy originálními archiváliemi, včetně knihovny a čítárny, jež je laděna do období první republiky a slouží široké veřejnosti. Toto muzeum je umístěno přímo v bývalých kasárnách, což umožňuje i možnost zážitku v podobě přenocování. Patrioti provozují také Hynčické lehké opevnění, tedy sestavu tří objektů vzor 37. z let 1935 až 1938. Tento okruh se nachází v oblasti obce Hynčice pod Sušinou, čtyři kilometry od Starého Města na jihovýchodním úbočí Sušiny. Spolek každoročně uskutečňuje jisté besedy v příslušném tematickém okruhu, činnost zaměřenou na mládež a jako hlavní akci pod názvem Dny armády s ukázkami zbraní a vojenské techniky, včetně konkrétního zásahu tehdejších obránců v dobových uniformách. Běžně samozřejmě je zájem o rozšiřování kvalitních exponátů v rámci darů od veřejnosti či koupě dle vlastních možností nebo sponzorů. --- Savig Savignat --- ´´´´´´´´´´ Vznik Československa ´´´´´´´´´´ Významné to datum, umocněné státním svátkem, kdy si připomínáme dlouholetou snahu vlivných politiků, jež vyústila 28. října roku 1918 ve vznik samostatného státu Československo. Tato událost je nejvíce spojována se jménem Tomáše Garrigue Masaryka, který se stal prvním prezidentem země. Územní hranice však v onom čase byly vykresleny v jiné podobě, než jak je známe dnes u České republiky. Zahrnovaly jak Českou republiku a Slovensko, tak i Podkarpatskou Rus. Toto Československo patřilo mezi nevyspělejší demokratické státy té doby. Státní vlajka i dnes má stejnou podobu jako vlajka při vzniku Československa. Oslavy státního svátku začnou hned ráno 28. října 2025 v areálu Národního památníku na Vítkově a dále slavnostní akt včetně udílení státních vyznamenání ve Vladislavském sále na Pražském hradě. Proběhne také den otevřených dveří do historických prostor Valdštejnského paláce a prohlídka Poslanecké sněmovny. Vytvořeno 25. října 2025 °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°° Aktualizováno 25. října 2025 Staroměstští patrioti na akci Cihelna 2025 a Fortfest CZ 2025 Ve dnech 15. a 16. srpna proběhla u města Králíky tradiční akce Cihelna 2025, jejíž součástí byl i nultý ročník Fortfestu. Fortfest je nová platforma, snažící se o propagaci muzeí hlavně s pevnostní tématikou. Muzeum vojenské historie a Staroměstska provozované spolkem Staroměstských patriotů se také této akcí účastnilo. S námi společně se ještě presentovala řada muzeí, jako muzeum opevnění K-S 5 U potoka , muzeum opevnění OP-S 25 Milostovice , muzeum opevnění N-S 82 Březinka , Bunkr Přáslavice , Spolek pohraniční historie – bunkr Vratěnín a především Společnost přátel československého opevnění, která provozuje muzea československého opevnění dělostřelecké tvrze Bouda a Hůrka . Především této společnosti a panu Robertu Čadovi chceme tímto poděkovat za uspořádání nultého ročníku Fortfestu CZ. Náš stánek byl navštíven mnoha návštěvníky, kde se jim dostalo informací o Muzeu vojenské historie a Staroměstska včetně pozvání k návštěvě našeho muzea a města Staré Město pod Sněžníkem. S velkým zájmem se setkaly i vystavené exponáty zbraní a techniky. Především děti si mohli zbraně prohlédnout a ""potěžkat"". Musíme s uspokojením konstatovat, že cca pro 20% návštěvníků jsme nebyli neznámým muzeem a to i díky lehkým opevněním vzor 37 na Štvanici v naší péči. Věříme, že tato akce nám pomůže zvýšit návštěvnost našeho muzea a města i jeho okolí. Začneme také s přípravou na další ročník Fortfestu. Zárukou pokračování této akce je i podpora od Pardubického kraje. Vojtěch Stochleba, spolek Staroměstští patrioti Světla nad bunkry Muzeum vojenské historie a Staroměstska provozované spolkem Staroměstských patriotů se opět účastnilo každoroční celostátní akce ""Světla nad bunkry"", věnované na počest vyhlášení zářijové mobilizace prvorepublikové armády v roce 1938. Letos tato akce již proběhla podesáté. Byli jsme potěšení, že akce se účastnili i naši sousedé v linii opevnění. Díky pěknému počasí byla i linie osvětlených těžkých objektů na Staroměstsku pěkně viditelná.

Na niezabudowanych terenach powstał monument z prowadzącą do niego reprezentacyjną aleją. Po obu stronach znalazły się groby, zarówno indywidualne jak i zbiorowe. Mimo, że to cmentarz, jego tereny zielone są miejscem wypoczynku i uprawiania sportów okolicznych mieszkańców. cmentarz dostępne całodobowo monument pomnik tablica pamięci Powiedz, jak bardzo lubisz to miejsce w Warszawie : Ulice: ulica Żwirki i Wigury Rok powstania: 1949-1950 Obszar MSI: Wyględów Wysokość: 35 m Funkcja: sakralna Styl: socrealizm Związane osoby: Jarnuszkiewicz ﻿Jerzy, Lachert Bohdan , Lisowski Stanisław Opis Obiekty do 1800 1800-1918 1918-1939 1939-1945 1945-1960 1960-1989 1989-2000 po 2000 Opis urbanistyczny: Cmentarz Mauzoleum Żołnierzy Radzieckich (ul. Żwirki i Wigury #10) to wojenna nekropolia. Skrywa prochy 21468 żołnierzy radzieckich, którzy polegli w walkach o Warszawę w latach 1944-1945. Ich prochy zostały ekshumowane i przeniesione tu po 1949 roku [2] . Pogrzebani zostali żołnierze walczący w różnych formacjach 1 Frontu Białoruskiego , m.in. 8 Armia Gwardii, 28, 47, 48, 65, 69 oraz 70 Armia, 2 Armia Pancerna Grupy Kawalerii Zmechanizowanej, 6 i 16 Armia Lotnicza, 46 Korpus Strzelecki, 2 i 7 Korpus Kawalerii oraz 1 Korpus Pancerny Gwardii [12] . Służyli tu nie tylko Białorusini, także Rosjanie, Kazachowie, Ukraińcy i żołnierze innych narodowości będących częścią ZSRR [4] . Na cmentarzu spoczywają również Żydzi walczący w szeregach Armii Czerwonej [8] . Nekropolia ma charakter rozległego parku z elementami mauzoleum o powierzchni 19.2 ha [2] (16.5 ha [14] ). Od ul. Żwirki i Wigury do centralnej części [5] przez trzy tarasy [14] wiedzie aleja. Na jej końcu znajduje się granitowy obelisk [5] . Przy wejściu na teren cmentarza od strony ul. Żwirki i Wigury stoją dwa postumenty z płaskorzeźbami oraz informacjami w językach polskim i rosyjskim [6] , przedstawiającymi wyzwolenie terytorium polskiego spod okupacji niemieckiej [7] . Po obu stronach alei głównej rozmieszczono 138 grobów oficerów oraz Bohaterów Związku Radzieckiego, znanych z nazwiska. Innych żołnierzy pochowano w 626 mogiłach zbiorowych, oznaczonych jedynie słupkami z numerami pól grobowych i czerwoną gwiazdą, chociaż wielu z nich jest znanych [9] . Inne źródła mówią o 294 grobach oraz 540 mogiłach [12] albo o 834 mogiłach [2] . Przy niektórych mogiłach da się zauważyć pomarańczowo-czarne wstążki , oznaczające, że pochowany odznaczony został orderami wojennymi [7] . Oprócz głównego dojścia, do obelisku prowadzą dwie boczne aleje. Rozrośnięte drzewa zasłoniły w tych alejach widok na obelisk. Wśród drzew sporą grupę stanowią gatunki roślin iglastych. Działka z parkiem i cmentarzem ma kształt zbliżony do trójkąta . Możliwe, że taki kształt to pozostałość ulicy prowadzącej od ul. Racławickiej, przez pola ""Agrilu"", do ul. Rakowieckiej [12] . Projekt cmentarza sporządził Bohdan Lachert. Dwóch artystów plastyków Jerzy Jarnuszkiewicz i Stanisław Lisowski było autorami wystroju rzeźbiarskiego monumentu, do realizacji którego zatrudniono 15 rzeźbiarzy. Są jednak rozbieżności dotyczące współautorstwa. Jako autora projektu zieleni źródła podają Władysława Niemirskiego [11] , Zofia Dworakowską [12] czy też Irmę Ignaczak, a współautorstwo pomnika przypisują Ob. Kewhiszwili [10] . W projektowaniu całości mogli też brać udział Irena Czarkowska [12] i Zygmunt Kleyff [1] . Projekt wyłoniono z konkursu ogłoszonego wśród studentów ASP [10] oraz otrzymał on po wykonaniu Państwową Nagrodę Artystyczną pierwszego stopnia [1] . Obiekty, pomniki, tablice: W centrum parku znajduje się obelisk z inskrypcjami na cokole oraz z gwiazdami pięcioramiennymi [12] na którym jeszcze do niedawna widniał napis: Ku wiecznej chwale bohaterskich żołnierzy niezwyciężonej Armii Radzieckiej, poległych w bojach z hitlerowskim najeźdźcą o wyzwolenie Polski i naszej stolicy Warszawy. Zmieniono go na: Pamięci żołnierzy armii radzieckiej poległych o wyzwolenie Polski spod okupacji niemieckiej w latach 1944-1945 [4] . Po obu stronach obelisku znajdują się monumentalne rzeźby żołnierzy Armii Czerwonej. Pierwsza, zatytułowana ""Bohaterstwo"" (po lewej) jest dziełem Jerzego Jarnuszkiewicza. Druga, ""Ofiarność” (po prawej), wyszła spod dłuta Stanisława Lisowskiego [7] . Rzeźby zostały wykonane z brązu i mają wysokość 3 metrów [3] . W zależności od źródła można znaleźć informacje, że obelisk mierzy 21 [7] , 23, 31, 35 [12] [5] lub 38 [11] metrów wysokości. XVIII wiek i wcześniej: Niestety nie wiemy nic o tym miejscu w wybranym temacie. XIX wiek: Niestety nie wiemy nic o tym miejscu w wybranym temacie. Okres międzywojenny: Niestety nie wiemy nic o tym miejscu w wybranym temacie. II wojna światowa i Powstanie Warszawskie: Niestety nie wiemy nic o tym miejscu w wybranym temacie. Odbudowa stolicy: Na zdjęciu lotniczym z 1945 roku na południe od ogródków działkowych Rakowiec znajdowało się pole lub łąka, ciągnące się do skrzyżowania z ul. Racławicką. Były to grunty dóbr ziemskich Folwarku Rakowiec, czyli teren Mokotowa [12] , dokładniej obszar Wyględów [11] . Pomysł budowy cmentarza powstał w 1949 roku. Cała inwestycję wykonano zimą i wiosną 1950 roku. 19 kwietnia obelisk był już gotowy. Uroczyste otwarcie miało miejsce 9 maja 1950 roku [12] .

Matthias holds a commission in the German Army and has, among other deployments, served on the defence attaché staffs at the German embassies in Paris, London and Madrid.

Travel to Hotel Rocca in Monte Cassino: https://www.hotelrocca.it/en/home-page.aspx 10 Oct: The prelude to the battle and the first battle of Monte Cassino. We will visit a number of locations, including San Pietro Infine, which was fought over in December 1943, and which was left in its destroyed state after the battle. We will visit the Italian cemetery and memorial at Montelungo and discuss the Italian contribution to the campaign. The German withdrawal from San Pietro opened up the Liri valley and the road to Monte Cassino. We will analyse the first battle of Monte Cassino and we will visit relevant locations, including the Rapido river at St Angelo, where the US troops suffered approx 50% casualties in their attempt to cross the river, and the German military cemetery at Caira, where we will discuss the French attack in the mountains 11 Oct: We will analyse the other 3 battles of Monte Cassino. We will examine the fighting in Cassino itself, and visit the museum dedicated to the battle. We will explore the remaining ruins (that hardly anybody knows about) of the old Monte Cassino, visit Castle Hill and the Monastery, which was bombed by the Allies during the second battle. We will explore the history of Cavendish road, the failed first tank attack through the mountains and the successful Polish attack here during the last battle. At the Polish cemetery we will discuss the Polish contribution to the battle and the enduring political importance of the battle within Poland. 12 Oct: We will travel to Anzio to analyse the Allied landings during Operation Shingle and the heavy fighting and followed. We will visit the American cemetery, the landing beaches, the military museum, and we will explore the fighting further inland, where the Allies were defending against ferocious German attacks. 13 Oct: Return to the UK, departing Naples International Airport on Easyjet Flight EZY8340 at 1035hrs. Arrive London Gatwick (North Terminal) at 1230hrs. Praise for Saul David and Matthias Ströhn’s previous tours Madrid and The Battlefields of the Spanish Civil War, 20-24 October 2021: Jeremy Archer: ‘Rack my brain as I might, I cannot think of a single thing that I would have done differently. Our trip was a truly excellent balance between warfare, culture and rest and recuperation. Matthias, I really don’t know how you manage to remain completely unflustered, “keeping your head when all about you are losing theirs …” Thank you particularly for making, re-making and then re-re-making the arrangements under such challenging circumstances.’ Jim Ferguson: ‘ Thank you again for another excellent tour. Battlefield tours just would not be the same without your knowledge, perspective and unerring instinct for an excellent restaurant! Already looking forward to 2022.’ Jonathan Skan: ‘ Seeing the places where actual events took place really brought everything to life and I shall always remember standing on the Republican start-line overlooking Brunetta and viewing the countryside where all-arms warfare was put into practice for the first time. I can only imagine how many hours you had to spend organising our four days in Madrid, but I enjoyed it hugely and look forward to next year’s adventure.’ Meet Saul David Saul David is a Sunday Times bestselling military historian, novelist and broadcaster. His history books include The Indian Mutiny (shortlisted for the Westminster Medal for Military Literature), Zulu (a Waterstone’s Military History Book of the Year), and Operation Thunderbolt: Flight 139 and the Raid on Entebbe Airport (an Amazon History Book of the Year). Alan Furst commented in the New York Times Book Review: ‘Tense and riveting…This is the achievement of a masterly, first-rate historian.’ The film rights for Operation Thunderbolt were bought by Hollywood’s Participant Media and used in the making of the motion picture ‘Seven Days in Entebbe’ which was released worldwide in the spring of 2018. The film is co-produced by Working Title, directed by José Padilha, and stars Rosamund Pike, Daniel Brühl and Eddie Marsan. In 2019, he brought out The Force: The legendary Special Ops Unit and WWII’s Mission Impossible , which was hailed as a ‘monumental achievement’ (Douglas Brinkley) and ‘an essential part of anyone’s library’ (Doug Stanton). His follow up book, Crucible of Hell: Okinawa – The Last Great Battle of the Second World War , was published in the spring of 2020 to coincide with the 75th anniversary of the campaign, and was shortlisted for the 2021 British Army’s Military Book of the Year. It was described by Antony Beevor as ‘Excellent…gripping narrative’ and named as an Amazon.com History Book of the Month and Daily Telegraph and Times/Sunday Times Non-fiction Book of the Year. In a 5-star review in the Daily Telegraph, Simon Heffer described Saul as ‘peerless now among our military historians’. SBS: Silent Warriors – The Authorized Wartime History , was published on 2 September 2021 to universal praise. ‘A terrific book,’ wrote James Holland in the Daily Telegraph , ‘written with all the gusto, thrills and head excitement these SBS operations richly deserve. It really is one of the most enjoyable histories I’ve read in many a year.’ It was an instant Sunday Times Top 10 bestseller, entering the list at No. 9 and climbing to No. 4 . lt includes previously unseen documents from the SBS Association Archives, the first-time that Britain’s top-secret maritime special operations unit has opened its doors to a historian. In 2022, Saul published Devil Dogs: First In, Last Out – King Company from Guadalcanal to the Shores of Japan , about a company of marines fighting its way through the Pacific. It was given a 5-star review in the Sunday Telegraph with Simon Heffer writing: ‘Superb… David has a claim to be our finest living military historian.’ It has been named a Times/Sunday Times and Daily Telegraph History Book of the Year. In 2024, Saul published Sky Warriors: British Airborne Forces in the Second World War . James Holland wrote in the Telegraph: ‘Fascinating and absorbing… The Red Devils were mostly young men, as vulnerable as any other soldier. Yet what they achieved, as David makes clear in this hugely entertaining book, was remarkable.’ It was a Sunday Times bestseller, reaching No. 8 in the hardback chart. Saul’s latest book, Tunisgrad: Victory in Africa , is published on 11 September 2025. Patrick Bishop described it as ‘Terrific – full of drama… It has profoundly altered my understanding of the Second World War.’ Saul has also written three historical novels, Zulu Hart , Hart of Empire and The Prince and the Whitechapel Murders . Saul has presented and appeared in history programmes for all the major TV and streaming channels. He is a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and a Professorial Research Fellow at the Humanities Research Institute, University of Buckingham. He was Professor of Military History at the University of Buckingham from 2009-2021.

Stojí nedaleko Starého Bohumína a je součástí stavebního úseku Moravská Ostrava, podúseku Bohumín. Po stavební stránce se jedná o atypický oboustranný samostatný dvoupodlažní pěchotní srub III. stupně odolnosti. Výběrové řízení na stavbu objektu vyhrála stavební firma Dr. Ing. Karla Skorkovského z Prahy. Vlastní betonáž objektu proběhla v červenci 1936 a trvala 14 dní. Množství betonu, který byl použitý na stavbu objektu, činilo 4 314 m 3 . Původní výzbroj objektu tvořily dva protitankové kanóny a čtyři samostatné těžké kulomety umístěné ve střeleckých místnostech. Tato výzbroj byla doplněna těžkým a lehkým kulometem ve dvou pěchotních zvonech, třemi lehkými kulomety v pomocných střílnách a šesti granátovými skluzy. Osádku objektu tvořili vojáci 1. roty, I. praporu hraničářského pluku 4. Bojová osádka čítala 42 vojáků, mírová osádka byla poloviční. K bojové osádce musíme přičíst dva důstojníky a tři dělostřelecké pozorovatele. V roce 1938 bylo území Bohumínska jakožto součást Těšínska obsazeno Poláky a objekt měl polskou osádku. V září 1939 Poláci ustoupili bez boje, území a objekt získalo Německo. Po roce 1945 byl objekt opuštěn. Od roku 1999 do dnešních dní o srub pečuje Klub vojenské historie Bohumín.

Nyní je spolkem a je registrován u Krajského soudu v Brně. Sdružuje amatérské i profesionální zájemce nejen o vojenskou historii. Členové jsou podle svého zaměření organizováni v příslušných sekcích. VHK Erika Brno svou činnost zaměřuje na sběratelství a amatérské bádání. Jeho členové se snaží získávat poznatky a dobové materiály, zúčastňují se a spolupořádají rekonstrukce vojensko-historických akcí, účinkují při natáčení televizních a video dokumentů, účastní se konferencí s vojensko-historickou tematikou apod. Aktivity klubu se však neomezují jen na území České republiky. Podstatnou část práce klubu tvoří pořádání expedic na bojiště I. a II. světové války. Tyto akce jsou především zaměřeny na průzkum prostorů, kde bojovaly československé jednotky. VHK Erika Brno vede, v duchu stanov, své členy k odmítání válek a násilí ve společnosti, jako negativního procesu mezi lidmi a zároveň se snaží prostřednictvím prezentace vojenské historie přispět k pravdivé informovanosti veřejnosti o podobách válek a jejich důsledků v naší i světové historii. VHK Erika Brno rovněž podporuje svojí činností a spoluprací s ostatními vojenskými historickými kluby, sdruženími veteránů a armádou zájem veřejnosti o vojenskou historii, která je nedílnou součástí našich dějin.
