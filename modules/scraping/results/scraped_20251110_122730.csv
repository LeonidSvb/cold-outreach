Read More The absolute relief I felt working with such an honest and organized company after dealing with a different HVAC company that overcharged us and failed to provide any documentation was so welcome. Immediately when I called Quality 1 Energy Systems in a panic and on the verge of tears I knew that I was in good hands from the moment they answered the phone. They have truly gone above and beyond by getting someone out to us ASAP to diagnose our AC issues, and the technician who came was incredibly professional, knowledgeable, and thorough. We received a detailed report with photos showing everything that was inspected and what needed to be repaired - everything was clearly laid out, which was not our experience with the other company we had worked with. It's a HUGE comfort knowing that we can trust and rely on Quality 1 Energy when we need them most. We haven't completed the repairs yet, but based on their transparency and professionalism, I have no doubt we'll continue to be thrilled with their work and I will be sure to update my review again after the repairs are completed. We plan to stick with this company for all future maintenance because they've earned our trust and treated us like family. I would highly recommend Quality 1 Every Systems for any of your AC or heating needs! UPDATE: Just as I had assumed, Q1ES continued to go above and beyond expectations. I'm updating this review as I sit in my COLD house after they completed my AC repair this afternoon (they arrived early and got the job done quickly too while still being extremely thorough). Zak even personally stopped by to check-in, which showed me even more just how great these guys are and how much they truly care for and value their customers. I will always choose to work with family-owned companies after this wonderful experience. I am SO grateful for Zak and his entire team for their hard work and high-quality service and look forward to being a lifelong customer!

I always had a spring and fall maintenance program in place. While I never had any issues, or needed major repair, I felt that it was the right time to replace it. I am a firm believer in Trane products having had multiple units at multiple homes all with a consistent good experience. I went to Trane’s website for a list of authorized dealers. I also asked a person I knew who is in the construction industry if his company had any experiences with Trane HVAC companies. He gave me a recommendation. I chose three companies and asked for quotes. All were certified Trane Comfort Specialists. One was the friend’s recommendation, one was a company that had performed warranty service on a mini-split system I have and the last one was a company that had good reviews. The dealer with whom I had a prior experience simply sent me an emailed price quote. The second sent a technician by who said someone will be back in contact with a price. It too was sent by email. Zach, with Quality 1 Energy Systems, came out, examined the system and took multiple pictures of it . He then spent time asking about my expectations and my likes/dislikes with the existing system. He shared his photos and made some suggestions including changing out some old duct work that should have been done twenty years ago. He later sent a detailed quote with all the individual pricing and terms. He followed it up with a phone call to answer any questions. To be fair to all companies, I sent them specific questions requesting updated figures for yearly maintenance pricing on our multiple systems, additional duct work costs, and labor charges for any Trane warranty work should it be required. One responded with caveats and minimal detail while the other, not at all. I chose Quality 1 which also happened to be the one my friend recommended. On installation day, Kevin and his team arrived and quickly started the changeover to the new system. They covered the floor and were careful in their handling of both the removal of the old equipment and the installation of the new. After they finished they shared pictures of the completed installation. It was cleaner than they found it! The system has been in for nearly a week and fully meets my expectations. Choosing the right dealer is crucial when investing in an HVAC system, especially with trusted brands like Trane at play. I am happy that I chose Quality 1 Energy Systems.

Book Now Google Schema We Have a Reputation For Being Punctual, Friendly and Knowledgable 5 (152 reviews) James Weaver 3 months ago “I have used other AC companies in San Antonio, some good, some not so good. One Hour did a superb job of taking care of me and my family and got us scheduled and done before we have some visitors in town. The tech was knowledgeable and helped uncover an issue that the other companies never had. We added a new UV light to wipe out mold before it gets to our air system. Call them if you want good service and good prices.” Mary McCullough 2 months ago “Dalton did a fantastic job repairing our ac unit today, 5 stars all around. He showed up on time and got right to work, going above and beyond by actually crawling under our indoor unit to check the coils. He was very friendly, explaining his repair process and answering all of my questions. I hope we don’t have a need for AC repairs in the future, but if we do, I will definitely request him coming out again!” Bianca Baca 5 months ago “This is the only AC company you need. Amanda and her team (specifically John) came out to my rental property and saved me from having to cancel on my guests. Within two hours John had a solution & my system was cooling my home. Other companies told me it wouldn’t be possible! Professional, fast, knowledgeable, and all did it all with a smile! 10/10 service.” Little Wolf 3 weeks ago “Our AC was on the brink of going out, we knew we were on borrowed time and then it happened. I called One Hour Heating and AC and they were here the next day. The whole system had to be replaced. They got the parts ordered and had the system set up temporarily until work could begin. Kirk the owner, and Oscar his lead supervisor (Oscar don't talk so much about yourself, your work speaks for itself. You got this, I see you going big places.) did a very through job. They did subcontract some help for the job and they were also very nice too. They worked very diligent to get it completed. When everything was turned on after installation, it was like night and day. I dont know how they worked outside in this Texas heat, but they did. Even though one subcontractor was very young, he did his very best. Missed a couple things (very minor) but One hour was out and corrected to issue with city inspection. I would recommend them to anyone who may need to repair or replace their AC unit. My daddy always said, do it right the first time, there is no need for a second time. Thank you for helping this old woman and her family.” Israel Cepeda 2 months ago “I had an excellent experience with One hour heating and air conditioning of SA! They responded to my request for service incredibly fast, which was a relief during the heatwave. Delton the technician who came out was very professional and knowledgeable, explaining everything clearly and ensuring my A/C was working perfectly before leaving. He was also very clean.

We worked to build relationships with several lenders to ensure our customers are able to restore comfort in their homes. Ask your technician about your financing options. What are the advantages of a smart thermostat? Smart thermostats learn a household’s patterns and adjust heating and cooling according to when a home is occupied, give homeowners the ability to control the thermostat remotely, and enable homeowners to reduce their energy use, saving you money. What is HVAC? HVAC means Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning. HVAC systems refer to air conditioners, furnaces, and any unit that cools indoor spaces during the summer and warm them in the winter. In general, an HVAC system takes in air, heats or cools that air, and blows it into a room or any indoor space. While many homes have separate air conditioning and heating units, others have a heat pump that cools and heats the house. Not only do HVAC systems maintain desired temperatures, but they also improve indoor air quality and regulate humidity levels. But most importantly, these units provide comfort all year round. What is a SEER rating? The SEER (seasonal energy efficiency ratio) is a measure of the efficiency of your heating and cooling system. The higher the SEER rating, the more efficiently a unit operates. The SEER rating of any given unit can range anywhere from 13 to 21.

The cost of your AC repair or installation depends on many factors that are rarely, if ever, the same. Because we need to do an onsite assessment, we cannot provide quotes over the phone. Call us and we’ll get you scheduled to get a quote in the Helotes and San Antonio area. What Should I Check Prior to Calling? Before contacting Mr. Wilson Air for furnace repair in the San Antonio area , go through the basics. Make sure you don’t have a dead thermostat or a tripped breaker. Then, put in a new air filter and make sure you have the system set correctly. If none of these things are to blame, reach out to us for a furnace diagnostics check. How Often Should I Check My Air Filters? You'd be amazed how many HVAC problems are caused by someone forgetting to change their air filter. If you use a 1-inch disposable filter, we suggest replacing those monthly. For people with a 4-inch media filter, two changes a year is often enough. How Do I Know if My Furnace is Under Warranty You'll want to start by finding out when your unit was produced. There's usually a visible production plate on the machine—the placement of it varies by brand and model. Once you have that, look up the manufacturer's warranty and see if yours falls within eligible dates. Note that some HVAC companies offer their own no-lemon and installation guarantees that go beyond what the factory offers. When Should I Have My AC Serviced? In the San Antonio area, we recommend getting your HVAC equipment serviced before the start of each season. In other words, AC maintenance should be done at the beginning of spring, while furnace tune-ups are best done in the fall. What are EERs and BTUs? You might hear our HVAC technician use these acronyms and not know what they mean. A BTU—a British Thermal Unit—is a measurement of heat. An Energy Efficiency Resource Standard (EERS), meanwhile, is a guideline used to represent the energy efficiency of an HVAC system. Why Can’t You Just Refill My Freon? Though your AC unit might work after a coolant refill, that’s a band-aid fix for a much larger problem. Because air conditioners are closed systems, any loss in refrigerant means there’s a leak somewhere. With many older systems using environmentally hazardous substances like R-410—which is now banned in new units and only available via reclamation—getting these refills can end up being more expensive than buying a new air conditioner that uses safer, lower-cost refrigerants. What Can I Do to Reduce My Utility Bills? Heating and cooling your home is the biggest contributor to most electric bills. Fortunately, there are things you can do to keep the prices down. These include: Keeping doors and windows closed Sealing leaks in your ducts and outer openings Scheduling annual furnace and AC tune-ups Community We live in the community that we service so we love to spend time and energy giving back to the people that make this area our home!

These systems are complex and require specific expertise and tools to handle safely and effectively. Without proper training, you risk causing severe damage to your home, voiding warranties, or worse, injuring yourself or others. Electrical repairs, in particular, pose significant risks, including electrical shocks, fires, and even fatalities. HVAC systems, while seemingly less dangerous, involve handling refrigerants and other chemicals that can be hazardous without proper knowledge and equipment. Incorrectly repaired systems can lead to inefficiencies, increased energy costs, and potential long-term damage, ultimately costing you more than hiring a professional. (325) 425-0540 Need Services?

The final estimate matched their quoted price. I liked that...but I did not expect that. Their quote was 25% less than my lowest quote, which made me suspicious but happy! However, Tanner knew exactly what he was doing and quickly replaced our 16-year old AC compressor that died. The company was easy to work with. They got me the exact compressor I wanted. I have a Goodman-Amana unit. Back to Tanner.....He was friendly while working quickly. After not having AC for the past 2 weeks in August with several 105 degree days, he delivered 62 degree coolness to a 85 degree house when he left. Many thanks to Tanner who conquered the Beast and the heat. I would highly recommend Anytime AC and Heating and especially Tanner. He certainly delivered as promised!

Our heating system would not go on, and by phone he walked me through all the processes to check for problems. He spent a great amount of time with me and explained step-by-step what to do. Andre solved our problem with his expertise and patience! Patti Bailey 03:46 17 Feb 25 In these current times, then customer service is usually terrible or just completely absent, Bellaire Air Conditioning is truly a breath of fresh air. (Yes, pun intended.) Now, I have had 3 different occasions where they worked on my house and all 3 times have been exemplary. Charlie, Michael and Andres are the epitome of professionalism. More than that, they really tried to give me the best solutions. I've had the arduous task of working with various HVAC companies over the years and sadly, many of them just try to gouge the consumer. Bellaire AC treated me like a neighbor. I greatly appreciate their insight and top-notch service. Paul Swen 23:38 05 Feb 25 We had a semi annual check. Our tech, Andres, was extremely thorough and made recommendations on how to keep our drain line clean and shorten the line from what a previous company suggested. He also recommended insulating the enclosed area where the indoor AC and heating are housed. I highly recommend Bellaire Air Conditioning. We have had them for over 6 years. I like that they explain what they’re checking and how it looks while they’re here. Laura Nine 15:46 02 Feb 25 Had our semi-annual maintenance today, and the very capable Andres was our technician. He was very friendly, thorough, and knowledgeable. Bellaire Air Conditioning installed our units in 2016, and we rely on them for all our maintenance. Janet McDow 16:49 17 Jan 25 I am writing to express our utmost satisfaction with the exceptional service provided by Bellaire Air Conditioning. In particular, I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to Andrew for his outstanding dedication and patient problem-solving skills.We have used Bellaire Air Conditioning for twenty or thirty years and we have always been completely satisfied with their service.

I highly recommend Bellaire Air Conditioning to anyone in need of reliable and efficient HVAC services. . Edward Mason 16:14 15 Jan 25 Andres came by today for our annual heat check.

He was also very kind and we really appreciate him taking his time to make sure our system is ready and safe for the cold weather!! Polly Johnson 23:06 13 Dec 24 Andres came out within 30 minutes of us calling on Saturday morning of Thanksgiving weekend. He fixed the furnace quickly and we have a cozy warm downstairs now.He was very nice and knowledgeable. Jan Harrell 20:59 30 Nov 24 This was my first time using Bellaire Air and I was very happy with the job Andres did. He fixed my problem fast and was so knowledgeable and thorough. I will definitely call them again for any future needs. Cherrise Traylor 22:31 26 Nov 24 We love Bellaire Air! Andres did our heat check this year and was both quick and thorough. He discovered our furnace was in dire need of replacement (it was far past its usual date of expiry, so we got a few extra years!), and he was very clear about our options.

Our Special HVAC Services in Houston Air Star Now is a full-service heating , ventilation, and air conditioning company. In addition to regular AC repairs, insulation installation, and other standard HVAC jobs, our technicians also solve special HVAC problems, such as keeping leaves out of your outdoor unit, removing unsightly hoses or pipes that run across the floor, or helping to safeguard your equipment. We understand that the needs of each customer are unique, so we strive to offer customized solutions tailored to their individual requirements. With over a decade of experience, our team is equipped with the skills and knowledge to get the job done right the first time around. Our team can help with the installation of: Ceiling Saver Kit. If your AC unit is in your attic or the upper levels of your property and your drains get clogged, the water collected during the dehumidification process can overflow onto your ceiling. To avoid a costly ceiling repair, our team can install a ceiling saver kit that collects water from leaks. Included in this kit is also a safety switch that can cut your AC off should a clog or overflow incident occur. Condensate Pump. This pump transfers wastewater to the proper drain, and our team can install the pump in an aesthetically pleasing way so that you don’t have pipes and hoses running across the floor. Easy-to-See Thermostats. This thermostat has large, raised numbers to help those with visual impairments, and they also make a clicking sound as you adjust the degree settings of your system. Hard Start Kit. Without a hard start kit, your compressor can become easily strained when it starts up and has to work harder than necessary. This puts additional stress on the air conditioner, ultimately reducing its lifespan without proper assistance. Installing a hard start kit is an easy way to increase efficiency while giving extra support during initial operation, preventing costly repairs or replacements down the line. Kool Kap. Your outdoor HVAC unit is constantly exposed to the elements (i.e., rain, snow, dirt, leaves, debris, etc.). This debris can collect at the bottom of your unit, which is a danger to your system, as it may rust or erode. To keep leaves and debris away from your unit and keep it clean year-round, we can install a Kool Kap, which protects your condenser. Protective Remote Monitoring Devices. To monitor your HVAC system when you aren’t home, our team can help you install monitoring devices and technology. Surge Suppressors & Lightning Arrestors. During the sweltering summer months, utility companies often face a high demand for electrical power, resulting in a reduction of their output—a phenomenon known as a brown-out. Such events can lead to serious, potentially irreparable damage to your household appliances, particularly your air conditioner. These appliances are specifically designed to operate at certain power levels; when these levels are reduced, the appliances are pushed to their limits, causing undue strain. Additionally, the threat of lightning strikes harming or even destroying your electrical appliances is ever-looming. By installing a lightning arrestor within your breaker box, you can safeguard all your appliances with ease. Time Delay Relay. This device helps you avoid burning out your compressor if your system’s settings are changed too often. With a time delay relay, your thermostat won’t adjust or turn on/off until up to five minutes after the last adjustment. Many customers with children who play with their thermostat benefit from this product. Air Star Now has been helping our customers address their HVAC needs since 2011. We offer free estimates and consultations, and we pride ourselves on offering our customers tailored solutions.

Regular maintenance is crucial to keep your HVAC system running efficiently and prevent unexpected breakdowns. It's generally recommended to schedule professional maintenance at least twice a year—once in the spring before cooling season and once in the fall before heating season. This ensures that your system is ready to handle seasonal temperature changes efficiently. During these visits, technicians can clean components, replace filters, check for wear and tear, and ensure everything is operating safely. Keeping up with maintenance helps prolong the life of your HVAC in Houston. What Are the Benefits of Upgrading to a Programmable Thermostat? Upgrading to a programmable thermostat can offer significant energy and cost savings. By allowing you to set specific times for heating and cooling to adjust based on your schedule, these devices reduce energy consumption. For example, you can program the system to lower energy use when you're not home and ramp up comfort settings just before you return. Over time, this can lower utility bills significantly while maintaining a comfortable indoor climate. As part of an HVAC contractor in Houston maintenance plan, we can show you how to maximize these benefits. Why Is My Air Conditioner Blowing Warm Air? There are several reasons your air conditioner might be blowing warm air. Common issues include low refrigerant levels, which could suggest a leak; a malfunctioning compressor; or an issue with the thermostat settings. Additionally, blocked or dirty filters can also restrict airflow and reduce cooling efficiency. It's best to have a qualified HVAC technician assess the system to diagnose and resolve the specific issue quickly. How Can I Improve Indoor Air Quality in My Home? Improving indoor air quality involves several strategies. Regularly changing HVAC filters is essential to prevent dust and allergen buildup. Installing air purifiers or whole-home ventilation systems can further enhance air quality by removing contaminants and replenishing stale air. Additionally, maintaining a regular cleaning schedule and managing indoor humidity levels can also significantly contribute to healthier indoor air. Consulting with an HVAC company in Houston can provide you with more options tailored to local concerns. What Should I Do If My Heater Isn’t Working? If your heater isn't working, first check the thermostat settings to ensure it's on the heat mode and set to an appropriate temperature. Also, inspect the circuit breaker to see if it has tripped. If these aren't the issues, the problem could involve the furnace's ignition system or a more complex mechanical failure. At this point, it's recommended to contact Air Star Now to ensure a quick and professional assessment and repair.

If you have acquired construction plans for a new residential or commercial building, we're your ideal HVAC installation partner.

Once you have your completed HVAC load calculation report and duct design, we will seamlessly take over, ensuring your new building's HVAC system is installed precisely according to your plans and local building codes. Comfortable Homes Start with the Right System Ensuring your home stays comfortable year-round starts with an appropriately sized air conditioning and heating system. A properly sized AC and heating system will provide efficient heating in the winter without unnecessary strain, helping prevent temperature fluctuations and promoting consistent warmth. During the summer, correct sizing is key for effective cooling and dehumidification; an undersized unit will struggle to maintain comfortable temperatures, while an oversized one may cycle too frequently, failing to reduce humidity adequately.

HVAC stands for “heating, ventilation, and air conditioning.” It’s the central system used to provide heating and cooling to buildings. Why is regular maintenance important? Regular maintenance is crucial because it keeps your HVAC system running smoothly, and prevents costly repairs, saving you money in the long run. Can indoor air be hazardous to your health? Indoor air can sometimes be hazardous to your health if it contains harmful pollutants like carbon monoxide and mold. Luckily, My HVAC Guy has the tools, knowledge, and skill to identify any potential contaminants. We can also install an air quality monitor so you can ensure that your air stays fresh and clean. Are all HVAC filter the same? No. Filters for residential spaces are generally smaller than larger ones used in commercial buildings like businesses and hospitals. Choosing the right air filter has an important impact on your air quality. We’ll help you find the right one for your space. How can I eliminated indoor odors? Working ventilation is essential for ridding your home or property of unwanted odors. Check out our air vent cleaning services to ensure you have the cleanest, best working air vents around. How do I choose the right humidifier? The right humidifier for you depends on your needs. There are many different humidifier types, including cool mist, warm mist, ultrasonic, evaporative, and vaporizers. Consult with one of our professionals for recommendations on the right humidifier for you. How often should I clean my air filter? Generally, you should clean your home air filter about every 90 days. This timeframe can vary depending on the number of residents or pets. We recommend scheduling regular cleanings to keep your filter immaculate and your mind at ease. Residential air filters should be cleaned every 20-45 days, depending on the amount of foot traffic the building receives. How often should I check my air filter? You should be checking your air filter about every 30 days. For best results, arrange regular check-ups with us to make maintenance a breeze. Should I have my air ducts cleaned? Yes. Clogged air ducts can lead to shortness of breath, poor air quality, and erratic temperatures. Regular cleanings will keep these problems at bay and ensure you always have clean air. What size heating and air conditioning system do I need? The size of the HVAC system you need depends on the type of property you have (residential or commercial) and your individual needs. Schedule a free consultation with My HVAC Guy for insight on what your property requires. How is the efficiency of heating and cooling equipment measured? We use multiple systems to determine the efficiency of your HVAC equipment. We employ everything from the EER (Energy Efficiency Ratio) to the MERV (Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value). Call us now to learn more. Why is the temperature uneven in my property? Clogged air ducts, a draft, a broken HVAC system—these are all possible causes of fluctuating temperatures. Schedule an assessment with My HVAC Guy to learn what’s troubling your HVAC system. How much does a replacement system cost? The total cost can depend on the size of the system needing replacement. Call us now at (817) 217-3120 for a free quote or estimate, or to schedule a consultation session. Testimonials I was very satisfied with the outstanding service provided by my hvac guy.

If you’re reading this, you’re probably thinking one of three things: 1: What the heck is an AC Genius? 2: What happened to the AC Genius website? 3: What about Plumbing and Electrical Geniuses? The answer to #1 is simple — remember the good ol’ days when “he does it for a living” meant “he really knows what he’s doing and he’s darn good at it”? That’s what an AC Genius is. An AC Repair tech that we’ve tested, trained, and screened to really know his trade and be darn good at it. So you get an honest expert who can diagnose the problem right, give you all your repair and payment options, and then fix it right, right then and there. We think that’s just a better way of doing business than sending our a salesman in disguise (aka, a “selling tech”), who’s better at selling than fixing. It’s why we always offer a Free Second Opinion to homeowners who suspect they just might have gotten a salesman instead of an expert AC Repair man . What Happened to The AC Genius Website? Once upon a time in the West, there was a family who grew up in the heating and cooling business, that somehow ended up running three different HVAC companies, all in the same area: Hobson’s Air Conditioning AC Genius Comfort Experts Well, eventually the two brothers thought it would be better to bring all three companies under one roof. That’s how Hobson’s Comfort Experts — Home of the AC Genius was born. So don’t worry, if you loved the service you got from AC Genius — or you were a club member with them — you’ll still get the same great service and club member privileges with Hobson’s Comfort Experts. AND you can be sure of continuing to always get a Certified AC Genius any and every time you call. What About Plumbing Genius and Electrical Geniuses? We’ve been serving the Westplex with honest plumbing and electrical service since 1962. And we’ve taken the same approach with every trade: hire for character, train for skill, stand behind your word and your work, and make sure there’s no “weak links” on your team. That’s why we can confidently certify our people as geniuses at their trade and craft. Stand-up guys who are great at fixing stuff, but who like helping people even more. And just like with Heating and Cooling, we also offer our famous Free Second Opinion for plumbing and electrical repairs. If you’re not sure you’re being given the straight scoop on a water heater replacement, sewer repair, or electrical repair, call Hobson’s Comfort Experts and we’ll send you a certified Plumbing Genius or Electrical Genius to shoot you straight and give you all your options.

MAINTENANCE PLANS HVAC REVIEWS FOR THE FIVE-STAR STATE Air Conditioning Repair in Fortworth, TX 76012 September 5, 2025 “Caring Customer Service is indeed Hawks mission. My Air Conditioner stopped working after a thunderstorm induced series of power outages. I contacted Hawk and initially they could not make it to my location until the next day, due to ongoing severe storms and already scheduled service jobs. I told the Scheduler/dispatcher I would check with other companies about same day service. The Hawk scheduler/dispatcher called me back several hours later and wanted to know if I still needed air conditioner repairs. I told her yes, and she said she would send a technician over immediately. The technician arrived shortly thereafter. He said he had worked through the downpours, using his umbrella, so he could get service calls completed. He quickly diagnosed the problem and had my ac running again. I am very impressed that Hawk called me back to check on my problem and with the dedicated technician who work through inclement weather to provide quality service to their customers. Hawk is my go to service provider for ac-heating and plumbing ( I had Hawk repair a main line water shut off valve for me a couple of years ago) issues.” - Barry M. Air Conditioning Maintenance in Saginaw, TX 76179 August 22, 2025 “We could not be more pleased or impressed with the service we received from Hawk! Ryan was professional, polite, efficient, and very knowledgeable. He installed our new water heater in a timely and efficient manner, and took time to answer all of our questions. Our interactions with Mike and Ryan were superb! I would recommend Hawk to anyone with no hesitation!” - Greg M. Water Heater Repair in North Richland Hills, TX 76182 July 14, 2025 “The technician was extremely smart at his job. Explained everything! We have used Hawk at our business and home. They are the best. If it hadn’t been for Hawk telling me not to pay a certain amount for a new hot water heater when they couldn’t get to me I would have been taken advantage of. The other local company had come in and unhooked wires and I didn’t even need a hot water heater but they knew I was desperate because I own a hair salon. If it hadn’t been for Hawk telling not to pay a certain amount I would have and didn’t even need one.” - Craig M.

Our Services Air Conditioning Services Learn More Heating Services Learn More Air Quality Services Learn More FAQ How often should I have my HVAC system checked? Most homeowners benefit from having their HVAC looked at twice a year—once before summer and again before winter. It keeps things running smooth and helps catch small issues early before they get expensive. How often do I need to change my air filter? It depends on your home. For most, every 1–3 months is enough. But if you’ve got pets or allergies, it’s smart to check it monthly. If it looks dusty or gray, it’s time to swap it out. What are signs my HVAC system might need repairs? Some red flags include strange noises, uneven temps in different rooms, or if your energy bill jumps unexpectedly. If it’s blowing warm when it should be cold, it’s definitely time to get it checked. When should I think about replacing my HVAC system? If your unit’s over 12–15 years old, needs constant repairs, or just can’t keep up anymore, it might be time to upgrade. Newer systems are more efficient and can actually save you money over time. Do you offer emergency repair services? Yes—if your AC goes out in the middle of a heatwave or your heater quits during a freeze, we’ll be there. We run 24/7 to keep homes safe and comfortable no matter what. What types of HVAC systems do you install? We work with central air, ductless mini-splits, heat pumps, and more. Whether it’s a new install or replacing something old, we’ll help you pick the right setup for your home and budget. Can you help improve my home’s air quality? Absolutely. From air purifiers to whole-house humidifiers and better filtration, we offer solutions that can cut down dust, allergens, and even odors inside your home. How long do HVAC systems typically last? With routine maintenance, most systems last anywhere from 15 to 20 years. Skipping tune-ups can shorten that lifespan, so it pays to stay on top of it. Do you offer financing for new systems? Yes, we have financing options that make getting a new unit easier on your wallet. Just ask—our team will walk you through the details and help you find the best fit. Are your technicians certified? Yes, every tech we send out is licensed, trained, and experienced. We don’t cut corners—just quality work by pros who know what they’re doing. support@newrisehvac.com (469) 579-9110 1003 Enterprise Pl #101 Arlington, TX 76001",4047.0,

This year, opted to call them directly outside of a home warranty on an investment property (due to long delays of 4-7 days in scheduling with two other companies) after a great experience last summer, and they were available within a few hours. Would’ve saved money but the repair was urgent with summer heat. Very affordable and will continue to use them should future needs arise! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Brad Boughner I called and asked for maintenance of my AC unit. They responded same day and set up the appointment for 2 days later. They gave me a 2 hour window and showed up right on time, after calling and giving me a 20 minute heads up they were on their way. Timely, thorough and quality work. They checked all my air handlers in the attic and both AC units outside. The tech explained everything that was found and fixed to my wife, and in a way she could understand (which she appreciated greatly!). I will use them again and recommend them to anyone looking for any HVAC services for residential or commercial needs. Top notch service, response, and professionalism. These guys truly know what customer service means, which is hard to find now days. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Adam McDavitt We’ve been a customer for about 20 years. The technicians are excellent. Very knowledgeable, reliable and extremely professional. Perform required work quickly and efficiently. Great customer service and support. Highly recommend this company for all your heat/air cooling systems. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Cathy Stern Contact Barrett Airworks Service Company Today Whether you need heating, cooling, plumbing, electrical, air duct cleaning, or other services, Barrett Airworks Service Company is your trusted partner.

Air conditioning replacement and conversion to refrigerated air offers significant energy saving benefits. A system that is 25 years old uses twice the energy required to operate a new system, so replacing it with a new energy efficient air conditioner or refrigerated air unit results in considerable home energy bill savings. When purchasing a new home air conditioning system, choosing the right size is important. Many people believe that bigger is always better, but this is not the case when buying an air conditioner for your home. An air conditioning system that is too large is more expensive and uses more energy. In addition, a system that is too large for your home will cycle more frequently, which reduces energy efficiency. At Western Electric, we help you select the right system for air conditioning replacement. We consider the size of the home, number of windows, insulation, shade, home appliances, and number of people in your home to determine the capacity required. Our expert technicians provide exceptional quality service and precision air conditioning installation. We offer free estimates for air conditioning installation and conversion to refrigerated air and we install all major brands of heating and cooling equipment.

Signs You Need HVAC Dealing with a malfunctioning air conditioner can be difficult. Learn to recognize the signs of needed AC repair or replacement. Rising energy bills, inconsistent cooling, and frequent repairs are signs of possible AC failure. Dirty coils, faulty thermostats, and compressor issues can lead to a complete breakdown. These issues often point to inefficiencies in your AC system. Regular AC maintenance helps avoid costly repairs and improves your home’s energy efficiency. Schedule a maintenance visit with a HVAC company like Birdwell AC & Heating to assess your AC’s condition. Age of Your AC Equipment As your air conditioning unit ages, the likelihood of potential damage and needed air conditioner repairs increases. Most systems last 10 to 15 years. After 15 years, units often become less efficient and reliable. EnergyStar suggests replacing air conditioning units older than 10 years. This recommendation is to prevent escalating repair costs and energy bills. Older air conditioning equipment can become challenging to fix due to unavailable parts. Frequent AC Repair Calls Frequent AC repair calls to our air conditioning service technicians can put a strain your wallet. Persistent problems with your air conditioner often mean it’s beyond its optimal age.Older AC units needing constant repair operate less efficiently than newer models. Continuous AC repairs could indicate complicated issues like dirty condenser coils or leaking ducts. AC installation and replacement help avoid ongoing repairs and offer a better energy-efficient solution. Invest in modern air conditioning system to avoid expensive, frequent fixes. Rising Energy Bills Most homeowners in Corpus Christi feel the impact of rising energy bills. Outdated air conditioning systems add more costs to your AC bill. Older units operate inefficiently, leading to increased energy consumption. This results in higher energy bills, even with minimal usage. Pair a newer air conditioning system with regular maintenance and reduce costs even more. With preventive maintenance, you can achieve better energy savings. The AC system works at its best, so you don’t lose money running it in the long run. Inconsistent Cooling Patterns Inconsistent cooling frustrates many homeowners and local Corpus Christi businesses. Often, old air conditioning units fail to provide even temperature distribution. Issues like insufficient refrigerant levels affect performance and cause temperature fluctuations. Leaky ducts, broken ducts, defective thermostats, and blocked air filters further aggravate the problem. Malfunctioning thermostat settings also impact cooling consistency. Routine AC maintenance and regular checks prevent these inefficiencies. AC Repair For anyone that lives here, hot summers in Corpus Christi often make reliable air conditioning a necessity. And here’s to hoping you don’t need any AC repair! Home and business owners rely heavily on their HVAC systems for comfort.

Core Values Straightforward & Fair Honesty & Integrity Reputable & Available Understanding Common AC Problems Corpus Christi’s hot and humid climate often causes air conditioning problems. The right AC system for your space and routine maintenance can prevent issues over time. Recognizing the signs of trouble early can avoid costly repairs later. Birdwell AC & heating does regular assessments of your AC system to ensure its longevity and efficiency. Keeping an eye on AC performance helps pinpoint when AC repairs are needed. Checking and Replacing AC Air Filters Regularly checking and replacing air filters prevents performance issues in air conditioners. Dirty filters obstruct airflow, making the air conditioner work harder than it needs to. Replacing filters every 1-3 months enhances energy efficiency and improves indoor air quality. Automation services like FilterFetch or even Birdwell AC & Heating simplify routine maintenance by delivering filters on schedule. Consistent maintenance lowers energy costs and boosts the life of the unit. A well-maintained filter reduces the need for frequent ac repair and maintains optimal AC system performance. Inspecting Circuit Breakers Inspecting circuit breakers is an important part of troubleshooting AC issues. A flipped switch often means a more serious problem. A tripped breaker might indicate an underlying bigger power issue that needs immediate attention. AC Repair Corpus Christi, TX Beat The Heat & Stay Cool!

John D Corpus Christi, TX FAQs Got Questions? We Have Answers! How often should I get my A/C checked in Texas? It's best to have your A/C system inspected and serviced once a yearâideally in the spring before peak summer heat. Regular maintenance helps catch small issues early and keeps your unit running efficiently. Is it worth getting a high-efficiency HVAC system for this heat? Yes, especially in Texas where systems run hard for much of the year. High-efficiency units can lower your energy bills significantly and keep your home more consistently comfortable in extreme temperatures. How long will my A/C last in this Texas weather? With proper maintenance, most A/C units in Texas last around 10â15 years. The intense heat and humidity can shorten a systemâs lifespan if itâs not regularly maintained.

Your commitment to the church and your valuable expertise is extremely appreciated! I look forward to continue working with you. Again, thank you GC Refrigeration for your professional services! Please let me know if you need anything from LFA or myself. HUNTER WATT , LAREDO FIRST ASSEMBLY “As small business owners we understand the attention to detail and importance that must be placed to customer service. When asking for recommendations that would fit these needs in Laredo, GC Refrigeration was always the first mentioned. Throughout the entire install with GC Refrigeration we were very satisfied with their business practices and the way they handled all our concerns and questions. They did a superb job installing our ice machine, beer draft system, and walk in cooler. They were the only company in Laredo that we trusted with our beer draft system which in our industry is key to overall sales and production of our business. We were and are still very satisfied even three months after the install with our walk-in cooler and the constant attentiveness that they have shown with their service and product. We hope to keep this business relationship going far into the future as we both grow and expand our business together with GC Refrigeration.” JAIME CAMPOS - OWNER/OPERATOR , BAR NIDO “Adrian installed our NEW State of the Art System about 3 1/2 years ago. Outstanding Service and very professional and courteous. Recently I needed help with some repairs, and Adrian arrived in a timely manner and took care of the problem and got us going again. He not only saved our sales, but I love the fact that he explained what was going on and needed to get us going. He was here the entire day until our system was repaired again and back to a flawless pour. If at anytime we were to do another of our establishment, Adrian would definitely be our to go guy.

Small fixes can be made during a tune-up, saving you money in the long run. Improve System Efficiency: Well-maintained HVAC systems run more efficiently, using less energy to heat or cool your home. This can lower your monthly utility bills and help reduce your environmental impact. Extend Equipment Lifespan: A well-maintained HVAC system lasts longer. Regular servicing ensures that all components are in good condition, reducing the likelihood of early system failure. Better Indoor Air Quality: Maintaining your HVAC system ensures better airflow and prevents the buildup of dirt, dust, and other contaminants that can affect indoor air quality.

We fix comfort problems that normal tune-ups ignore: hot rooms, humidity, high bills, and air quality in real Grapevine homes. What homeowners in Grapevine actually want fixed Here's what we hear in Grapevine: ""The back bedrooms are always hot,"" ""The air feels humid and sticky,"" ""The bill jumped a lot this summer,"" ""One room smells dusty when the system kicks on."" Those are comfort and air quality problems, not just ""equipment problems."" Replacing equipment without fixing airflow, leakage, and insulation usually does not solve those complaints. It just makes the same issues more expensive. What we do as your HVAC contractor We approach the home like a system. The goal is steady temperature, controlled humidity, clean indoor air, and lower wasted energy. We provide: • AC repair and performance restoration • Heating and furnace repair • Duct sealing and airflow balancing room by room • Attic insulation and air sealing to reduce heat gain and heat loss • Indoor air quality and filtration upgrades • Equipment replacement when it is actually the best answer Everything starts with our paid $89 Comfort Audit . You get a documented readout of what is driving the comfort problem. You see recommended fixes in writing. No pressure language. Just facts and next steps. Typical Grapevine project pricing → Duct sealing / airflow correction: $1,500–$3,500 → Attic insulation and air sealing: $2,000–$6,000 → Whole attic performance package: $4,000–$10,000 → Indoor air quality systems: $800–$4,000 → Full system replacement (when appropriate): $10,000–$20,000+ Proof from Grapevine A Grapevine homeowner near Main Street had one upstairs room that stayed 6 degrees hotter than the rest of the house. After airflow correction and sealing duct loss, that room now sits within about 1 degree of the thermostat, and cooling runtime dropped significantly. What Grapevine homeowners say ""One upstairs room stayed 6 degrees hotter. After airflow correction and sealing duct loss, that room now sits within 1 degree of the thermostat."" Brandon T. Grapevine ""They showed me exactly what was wrong with data, not just guesses. Fixed the real problem instead of selling me a new system."" Sarah M. Grapevine Grapevine area map Common questions from Grapevine homeowners What makes you different from other HVAC contractors in Grapevine? We approach the home like a system. The goal is steady temperature, controlled humidity, clean indoor air, and lower wasted energy — not just equipment replacement. How much do typical HVAC projects cost in Grapevine? Duct sealing and airflow correction runs $1,500–$3,500. Attic insulation and air sealing costs $2,000–$6,000. Full system replacement when appropriate is $10,000–$20,000+. Do you really show the data from diagnostics? Yes. We measure temperature, humidity, airflow, and pressure. You see the numbers and we explain what they mean in plain language. Who we are a fit for If you only want the absolute cheapest short-term patch, we are probably not your contractor. If you want the house to finally feel comfortable and efficient and you want to understand exactly why it hasn't, that is our lane.

We are offering a $7 service fee for new customers and that fee will cover getting our technicians through the door and able to diagnose the unit. Once completed, the technician can offer a quote that will outline all work that needs to be done. You can choose if you would like to immediately accept that repair or give it some time to think about it. If you have any questions or concerns, then, of course, you can always call our office staff! We are a company that never stops running as we are open 24/7!

If you need a service call, just call the office and get scheduled with us for the soonest availability. We can go out and complete a full inspection on your unit. Once we have gathered what is wrong, we can give a report to you including a price and time frame for the repair. If you have any questions about the repair, please ask the HVAC Lubbock technician or one of our great office members so they can further explain. We also do preventative maintenance and tune-ups prior to the major seasons. These include cleaning and inspecting the unit before any problems occur to prevent a major repair from being needed in the future.

Repairs are enough of an issue without a company trying to scam you into buying parts you don’t need or buying for labor they won’t do.

We understand that each situation differs from home to home and that is why we offer quotes that are available for you to sit and think on.

We know how big of a change one repair can cause so get it fixed up today! We are also preparing ourselves for the R22 phase out that will begin in January of 2020. This will affect homeowners that will need freon for their older equipment. Any equipment manufactured before 2010 will use R22 and will need to switch to R410-A refrigerant or a replacement refrigerant. R22 will be available temporarily afterward but only until each vendor sells out. Eventually it will no longer be sold anywhere and the homeowner will still have to flush their system and replace the freon. R22 will come at a high price and will only be a temporary fix. The money spent on R22 can be invested in new equipment or replacing the freon with an actual replacement freon. If your equipment is still using R22 refrigerant, it is probably an older unit that will, sooner rather than later, need repairs or to be replaced. We have a full explanation of this located on our website at snowbearair.com that goes in-depth about the different types of freon, what all the options are and why it is not only something to consider but something to prepare for! Unexpected changes can be overwhelming and a headache to deal with. However, if there is a plan involved, it can be dealt with ease. If you have any questions or concerns on what you should do, give us a call! 806-367-9416 We are very excited to be moving forward with our company and continuing to grow and be able to assist more individuals! If you are in the area, please give us a call and set up your first appointment today for just $7! We would love to help you repair that equipment so you may be able to get back to your comfort normal! If you need maintenance or a tune-up, we can get you scheduled for that too! If you would like a quote, call now and we can begin the process of getting you brand new equipment with warranties and labor included! Our flat-rate pricing makes is all-inclusive for our HVAC Lubbock customers!

We called late night because our air conditioning wasn’t blowing cold air and they were able to have technicians at our door first thing. They were able to diagnose the issue and fixed it really quickly and was beyond reasonable as far as cost goes. Johnny R. And Mukeya were really friendly and knowledgeable and made great recommendations based off of our needs! They were also so kind to all 4 of our crazy dogs which was incredible. We will definitely be staying with them for any future services!” Mika Pendergrass (Mika) 4 weeks ago “One Hour Heating & Air Conditioning is truly awesome. Not only were they swift with offering me same day service, they are cost effective and provide a notable professional experience. Johnny, their senior technician was awesome. Not only was he super knowledgeable and very informative, he is also welcoming, ultra professional and cares about getting the job done right. I will absolutely be recommending One Hour after this experience.” Tex Rodriguez a month ago “Just had Johnny R and his assistant out.....LOTS of info and VERY helpful!! He told me what all is needed and some tips to try myself! Was early and called to let me know....Very professional and THANKS for your time and help!” James & Anastasia Adams 2 months ago “Gage came out within 2 hours of my scheduling the service call after realizing that our AC went out overnight. He had it diagnosed and fixed within minutes. He was professional, knowledgeable and explained everything so it was easy to understand. I would definitely recommend him and the company! The price was reasonable. We even signed up for the yearly maintenance service.” Brent Smithers a month ago “My AC system wasn’t cooling so I called One Hour Heating & AC. They sent Johnny R. out this morning and he confirmed what I pretty much already suspected, it was done. My system is 22 years old so it was no real surprise. What did surprise me is the time and effort Johnny R spent making sure that was indeed the case. He didn’t just automatically say that I needed a new system, he checked everything. I was also surprised at how reasonable the price was, much lower than I expected. I was also shocked at how fast they could replace it, they will be here tomorrow. I am very pleased with the service I received from One Hour Heating & AC and especially the service I got from Johnny R.” Special Offers Mention these discounts at time of service View All $75 OFF ANY HVAC REPAIR over $399 - Limited Time call us at (469) 259-2654 Expires: November 14, 2025 Valid at participating locations.

How often should I service my HVAC system in Aubrey and Celina? It’s ideal to service your cooling system each spring and your heating system each fall to ensure you find small issues before they become big problems. Do you offer HVAC financing in Aubrey and Celina? We work built relationships with several lenders to ensure our customers are able to restore comfort in their homes. Ask your technician about your financing options. How often should I have my furnace serviced in Aubrey and Celina? It’s recommended to have your furnace professionally serviced once a year, ideally in the fall before the heating season begins in Aubrey and Celina. Annual maintenance helps ensure safe operation, improves efficiency, and can extend the life of your system. How often should I have my air ducts cleaned in Aubrey and Celina? It’s generally recommended to have your air ducts cleaned every 3 to 5 years in Aubrey and Celina, or more often if you notice dust buildup, allergies, or musty odors. Homes with pets, recent renovations, or high pollen levels in Aubrey may benefit from more frequent cleanings to maintain healthy indoor air quality. How often should I schedule AC maintenance in Aubrey and Celina? You should schedule AC maintenance once a year, ideally in the spring before the cooling season starts in TX. Regular tune-ups help your system run efficiently, prevent breakdowns, and extend the life of your unit, especially important in Aubrey and Celina's summer climate. What size HVAC system is right for my home in Aubrey and Celina? The right HVAC system size for your home in Aubrey and Celina depends on factors like square footage, insulation, number of windows, and local climate. A professional load calculation ensures your system is properly sized for comfort and efficiency. Oversized or undersized units can lead to higher energy bills and uneven temperatures.

The point is that any number of problems can compromise your cooling system. However, with our HVAC specialists, you can look forward to your unit returning to normal. But don't forget that the sooner your problem is brought to our attention, the better it is for you.

It may be an innovative solution to invest in a new and up-to-date unit. AC repairs may seem like the more affordable option, which usually solves most problems; however, it might be worth exploring other options, such as getting an entirely new AC, as a more long-term solution. Need To Get Your Air Conditioner Serviced or Repaired? Call Today! Repairing your air conditioning system is a challenging task. Therefore, avoid relying on amateur repair companies, as a single mistake can completely compromise the system. But you don't have to worry anymore.

John was able to come out and snake the drains. Unfortunately, the next day they were backing up again. This was during a snowstorm. He came out the day after, braving the snow, ice and the elements And stayed there snaking the drains for 2+ hours (On the roof, on the ground level). After two hours, the toilets were working, but he found out that there is a hole in the sewer line pipe underneath my house, which will require some extensive work. However, he did get the toilets and working order for a little while until I can explore my next option. I can’t thank John enough for the time he put into helping me. I will use him again and again for the rest of my natural days on this earth when I need a plumber. Connie Moon 21:10 30 Dec 24 Great service as always by Randy Gutierrez.

Frequently Asked Questions How often should air conditioning units be serviced? For optimal performance, it is recommended to have your air conditioner serviced twice a year: once in the fall and once in the spring. In the fall, you should check the air filter, inspect the condenser coils, and make sure the refrigerant levels are correct. In the spring, you should check the evaporator coils, inspect the fan motor, and make sure you check the evaporator coils. What does an AC tune up include? An AC tune up includes a full calibration of the thermostat, inspection of the ductwork for energy loss, tightening and inspection of all electrical connections, evaluation of the blower motor and condition of the blower belt, checking refrigerant charge levels and air flow, inspecting refrigerant leaks, and checking the run capacitor for bulging and/or unusual markings or colors. It is important to have an AC tune up done regularly to ensure that your system is running efficiently and safely. This will help to reduce energy costs and extend the life of your system. Additionally, it can help to prevent costly repairs in the future. What is the most cost effective AC system? The most cost effective AC system for cooling an entire home is the Lennox XC25, which has an outstanding SEER rating of 26 and is rated most efficient by EnergyStar for 2022. For a more affordable option, consider a ductless mini-split AC to cool one or two rooms. Why is my AC running but not cooling? It is likely your AC is not cooling due to a clogged or dirty air filter, or ",15000.0,

Frequently Asked Questions Does Bralley Works Heating and Air Conditioning offer financing? admin 2025-01-03T15:34:48-06:00 Does Bralley Works Heating and Air Conditioning offer financing? Yes, we work with a local bank to ensure that when an emergency happens, you are able to keep your family safe and sound during the harsh seasons. How can I make my unit last longer? admin 2025-01-03T15:32:01-06:00 How can I make my unit last longer? We understand that you want your system to last as many years as possible. Frequently changing air filters is very helpful. Servicing your HVAC system annually will increase the lifespan of your unit. By servicing your unit routinely, an HVAC specialist can ensure your unit is functioning by replacing any damaged parts and that your freon is fully charged for the upcoming season. How long does HVAC equipment last? admin 2025-01-03T15:33:24-06:00 How long does HVAC equipment last? A HVAC unit should last around 15 years, but efficiency degrades over time, and your energy bill goes up the older your unit is. We have seen units over 30 years old still running, but the energy bill was quite high. We always try to help you keep your HVAC system lasting as long as possible, but sometimes replacing a unit is cheaper than keeping a unit that is using more energy as well as has more expensive parts to replace. Technology within the heating and air conditioning realm has only been increasing in efficiency. Therefore, we suggest sometimes that the best choice is to update your system. How often should I change my air filter? admin 2025-01-03T15:26:39-06:00 How often should I change my air filter? We recommend 1-3 months. This number depends on a variety of factors: how many pets do you have, how old are your windows and doors, and other contaminants that are present in your home. Check your filter frequently to determine if it’s dirty. If it is, then you should change it. We never recommend going over three months before changing air filters. The more often air filters are changed, the more you are able to increase the lifespan on your unit. Is Bralley Works Heating and Air Conditioning open weekends? admin 2025-01-03T15:35:44-06:00 Is Bralley Works Heating and Air Conditioning open weekends? Yes! We understand your HVAC systems don’t just break down on weekdays. We are available 7 days a week! What is a heat pump? admin 2025-01-03T15:34:16-06:00 What is a heat pump? A heat pump is an environmentally friendly and efficient way to cool and heat your home. The heat pump is installed outside your home, using electricity to transfer heat into your home during cold weather, and pull heat from inside your home during warmer seasons. This transfer of heat is all done by refrigerant and does not burn fossil fuels like traditional furnaces. What is a mini-split and why should a professional install? admin 2025-01-03T15:31:00-06:00 What is a mini-split and why should a professional install? A mini-split is a ductless compact heating and air-conditioning system. Some homes don’t have enough space for required duct work on conventional systems or are lacking in room to put a furnace in the home/attic. Mini-splits are also used to supplement rooms that do not get cold or hot enough in your home. We recommend a licensed HVAC professional to install mini-splits because they have the proper tools and equipment to safely install systems up to city code. What size unit should I have for my home? admin 2025-01-03T15:30:04-06:00 What size unit should I have for my home? This question depends on many factors: How old is your home, thickness of walls, r-value of insulation, attic space, the amount of windows and doors in your home, and a lot of other variables! A system that is too small will run constantly, running up your energy bill. Choosing a system too large can result in a home that’s too humid which brings on moisture and mold. Only a qualified HVAC technician can calculate and determine what size unit is best for your home. What types of HVAC does Bralley Works install and repair? admin 2025-01-03T15:35:17-06:00 What types of HVAC does Bralley Works install and repair? We are able to service both commercial and residential properties. Why is my unit freezing up and not cooling my house? admin 2025-01-03T15:29:11-06:00 Why is my unit freezing up and not cooling my house? This isn’t a simple question, but there could actually be many reasons involved. A prominent culprit is that your system is low on freon. This is often due to a leak in your system which is caused by usage over the years, creating pinholes in your system that slowly…or quickly lose freon. Only an HVAC specialist is able to come and find the leaks to repair, as well as properly charge your system to the correct pressure needed. Another common cause is due to a dirty evaporator coil, which then slows the airflow into the home, ultimately leading to the system freezing up. A HVAC specialist is able to assess any damages and properly clean the coil. Why should I update my unit if it uses R-22 freon? admin 2025-01-03T15:28:10-06:00 Why should I update my unit if it uses R-22 freon? Manufacturers no longer make HVAC systems utlizing R-22 freon. R-22 freon is no longer allowed in new equipment due to environmental regulations. Since many existing air conditioning units still use it, R-22 is still produced, but is being phased out. This means that as time goes on, it will become more expensive to repair and harder to find parts for your unit.

All star has serviced my home for over 15 years. Because of their work quality and their history, I will continue to use them for my heating and air conditioning needs. Thanks guys for great service. Victor B. All-Star Heat & Air did a great job on replacing my furnace that was original from 1976! Chuck helped me speed up my home warranty replacement paperwork which was awesome. Colton came and diagnosed the problem. He also checked in with me several times. Chris and Austin did an excellent job with install getting everything up to code. They even went above and beyond to make sure everything was vented properly and finished out. I definitely would recommend this company! Susan L. I contacted All-Star after receiving a rather hefty estimate on my older AC system in my house. Chuck and his team were very quick to answer and managed to get to me in a reasonable time. It was in the midst of a heat wave and they were super busy. They diagnosed a completely different issue, at a much more reasonable price and had us back up and running. At all times they were up front and explained the issues and what they possible causes and solutions might be. Since that first time, I have used Chuck and All-Star for other issues and highly recommend them and their service. Will B. Over the years, I’ve had many problems with my older system (yes it probably needs to be replaced). All-Star has always fixed me up in an extremely timely manner, much faster than expected. At a very fair price. If they can keep a system as old as mine going, they can fix just about any system. I recommend All/Star to everyone that I know. And when it comes time for a new system, I would not use any other company. Awesome company very highly recommend! Levi R. READ ALL REVIEWS Go to Top",4010.0,

Our services are listed below, covering everything from full installations to routine inspections. If you’re not sure where to start, these pages offer details based on real questions we hear from customers every week. Furnace Repair & Installation Nobody wants to wake up to a cold house on a freezing Amarillo morning. When your furnace decides to quit working, it’s usually at the worst possible time. We’ve seen it all; from simple thermostat glitches to major component failures that need immediate attention. Most of the time, we can get your heat back on the same day because we stock the parts that fail most often. If your furnace is getting old and repairs are becoming expensive, it might be time to consider replacement. That’s where our complete HVAC System Installation service comes in handy. Sutton Heating and Air handles everything from removing your old unit to getting your new system running perfectly. Heat Pump Repair & Installation Heat pumps are pretty amazing when you think about it; they heat and cool your home using the same equipment. But when something goes wrong, you’re stuck without either heating or cooling until it gets fixed. We work on all the major brands and know these systems inside and out. Installing a new heat pump isn’t something you want to trust to just anyone. The sizing has to be exactly right, or you’ll have problems for years. Our team specializes in New Construction HVAC projects where getting it right the first time matters most. We’re actually certified through the Bonneville Power Administration for heat pump commissioning, which means we know how to make these systems work efficiently. AC System Repair & Installation Summer in Texas doesn’t mess around, and neither should your air conditioner. When your AC breaks down in July, you need someone who can fix it fast. We’ve built our reputation on quick response times and getting systems back up and running the same day whenever possible. Sometimes repair isn’t the smartest choice, especially if your system is older and having frequent problems. Our HVAC Repair Service includes honest assessments about whether fixing or replacing makes more financial sense. When replacement is the way to go, Sutton Heating and Air installs systems that can handle whatever Texas weather throws at them while keeping your energy bills reasonable. Ductless Mini-Split Repair & Installation These ductless systems are becoming really popular, and for good reason. They’re perfect for additions, garages that got converted to living space, or just rooms that never seem to get comfortable. The best part is you can control the temperature in each room independently. We’re a Mitsubishi Diamond Dealer, which means we know these systems better than most contractors. But we also service other brands when things go wrong. For businesses that need precise temperature control without wasting energy, our Commercial HVAC Services include ductless options that can save a lot of money on utility bills. These systems are more sophisticated than they look, so proper installation really matters. Indoor Air Quality Services You might not realize how much dust and allergens are floating around your house until you start paying attention. Amarillo’s wind doesn’t help matters, and seasonal allergies can make life miserable for some families. Poor indoor air quality affects more than just comfort; it can trigger asthma attacks and make respiratory problems worse. We start with detailed HVAC Inspections and Diagnostics to figure out what’s actually in your air and where it’s coming from. Then we recommend solutions that make sense for your situation. Our Indoor Air Quality Solutions range from better filters to whole-house purification systems. Sutton Heating and Air has helped many local families breathe easier at home.

You’ll find us working in neighborhoods like The Colonies, Ridgecrest, and Wolflin, helping customers keep their homes steady no matter what’s happening outside.

Whether your unit is short cycling, blowing warm air, or completely silent, we’ll give you a straight answer and a clear path to getting it fixed. Heating Contractor Amarillo winters may be short, but when the cold sets in, a slow or uneven heating system can make a home miserable. As a Heating Contractor in Amarillo, TX, we work on gas furnaces, heat pumps, and electric setups in older homes around San Jacinto and newer builds in Hillside Terrace. Some calls are for simple fixes—others need a closer look. We test key components, inspect wiring, and check for issues that could turn into expensive problems later on. Furnace Repair Service A frost warning can hit Amarillo overnight, and an unresponsive furnace leaves rooms colder than the wind off Palo Duro Canyon.

We arrive with replacement parts common to local brands, run combustion checks, and test for carbon-monoxide leaks before restarting the system.

About Sutton Heating and Air In Amarillo, we deal with extremes—100° summers, hard freezes, and wind-driven dust that clogs up outdoor condenser coils faster than most people realize. At Sutton Heating and Air, we’ve spent years diagnosing short-cycling systems caused by cracked heat exchangers, fixing low airflow due to poorly sized ductwork in early 2000s builds, and correcting static pressure problems in older ranch homes across Puckett and Sleepy Hollow. Our crew knows how to handle Lennox and Trane variable-speed systems, how to balance airflow in multi-zone setups, and when it’s time to recommend a heat pump over a gas furnace based on insulation and utility rates, not sales targets. We carry manometers, combustion analyzers, and thermal imaging tools on every van, not just a set of gauges. For more insight into how we work and what sets us apart. Our goal has never been growth for its own sake, it’s been doing the job right. Call Now! Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How to choose a good HVAC contractor? Start with someone local. In Amarillo, you want a contractor who knows what dust does to coils and how fast temps can swing in spring. Ask if they’re licensed and insured, but also ask how they size a system or what they check during repairs. At Sutton, we’ve worked in everything from small ranch homes to commercial shops. We explain what we’re doing, why it matters, and we don’t disappear after the job’s done. Q2: How do I find an honest HVAC company? Talk to someone who answers questions without dancing around them. An honest HVAC company will tell you what’s wrong, what’s urgent, and what can wait. You should get real answers, not just a sales pitch. We’ve been in Amarillo long enough that word gets around. Sutton doesn’t oversell equipment or pressure folks into contracts they don’t need. We treat your system like we’d treat our own—and that’s how we’ve stayed busy. Q3: Can I install my own HVAC in Texas? You can, but unless you’re licensed, it’s probably not worth it. We’ve seen a lot of DIY jobs go sideways, units too big for the house, poor airflow, ductwork that rattles every time the system kicks on. Most brands won’t honor a warranty unless it’s installed by a pro. When Sutton does an install, we handle permits, pressure testing, airflow balancing, all the details that keep things running right, not just running. Q4: How do I choose an HVAC system? First, pick the system type, central air, ductless, or a heat pump. It depends on how your home is built and what you’re trying to fix. Next, look at efficiency. A higher SEER rating can save you money, but only if the rest of the system is set up right. Last, ask how it’s controlled, smart thermostats, zoning, or simple manual setups. We walk customers through all of this before we recommend anything. Q5: Does brand matter for HVAC systems? It does, but not as much as people think. The biggest difference isn’t the logo on the unit, it’s how well it’s installed. We’ve replaced plenty of high-end systems that were put in wrong. At Sutton, we’ve worked with all the big brands—Trane, Carrier, Lennox, but what we focus on is proper sizing, airflow, and access for future maintenance. A good system installed right will always outlast a great one installed wrong. Q6: What should I look for in an HVAC quote? You want more than just a total price.

With regular maintenance, any appliance or component can last longer and run more efficiently, saving you money and avoiding inconvenient breakdowns. Plumbing Services If your toilet is running or you hear dripping from the walls, there is likely a leak somewhere. If you smell gas, a dangerous gas leak can cause a fire or explosion (not to mention health emergencies). Our gas plumbing professionals can quickly fix or replace your gas line. When there’s a water leak, we employ leak detection tools to find its exact location and provide sealing or repiping as necessary. Slow drains can be addressed with drain cleaning, but for deeper problems, our sewer cleaning experts can get to work, or we can provide non-invasive sewer repair and tree root removal.

What is HVAC service? HVAC service refers to the routine maintenance, repairs, and sometimes installation performed on your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system. Think of it as a regular check-up for your system, where a professional inspects, cleans, and tunes components to ensure efficient and reliable operation. 2. How often should HVAC be serviced? It's generally recommended to have your HVAC system professionally serviced at least once a year. Ideally, you should schedule two service appointments annually: one in the spring before the cooling season and another in the fall before the heating season. This ensures your system is running optimally for the demands of each season. For older systems or those in regions with extreme climates, more frequent servicing might be beneficial. Additionally, regularly changing your air filters (every 1-3 months) is a crucial part of ongoing maintenance that you can do yourself. 3. What services does High Tech HVAC offer? We specialize in HVAC installation, repair, and maintenance, including air conditioning and heating systems. Whether you need a quick fix, regular tune-up, or a new system, we’ve got you covered. 4. Why should I choose High Tech HVAC? We combine cutting-edge technology with expert technicians to deliver energy-efficient solutions and exceptional customer service. Your comfort and satisfaction are our top priorities. 5. How often should I schedule HVAC maintenance? It’s recommended to schedule maintenance at least twice a year—once before summer and once before winter—to keep your system running efficiently and prevent unexpected breakdowns. Search",6049.0,

Call us for all of your Air Conditioning repair, AC service, or maintenance . We would also be glad to do any electrical upgrades or repairs that you might need. Why people believe in us I thought ""something"" was wrong with my heater. I called CWS and the gal that answered said she didn't schedule appointments, but would have a tech call me. I was thinking the next day. NOPE. I received a call within ten minutes, and the best news .... the tech was able to see me immediately. Aaron was professional and patient with me, as I asked him a lot of questions, thinking something was wrong with my heater. Thank goodness it was nothing, routine maintenance. DO NOT hesitate to call this company, they are truly amazing. Truly. Dawn A Very pleased based on my one experience. I had a problem with a breaker and had called 3 other places and was repeatedly told that the next available appointment was 2 or 3 weeks out. I called CWS and they were able to come out later that day. My tenant (I wasn't there) said they were very professional and courteous. I did talk to them on the phone and they answered all my questions and explained the problem. The amount charged was very reasonable. I plan to use them soon for something else I need done . Bucky W It's taken me a year to write this review, but I wanted to make sure that people know what an awesome job these guys do! Last summer, I had Juan come out and install a pendant light above my kitchen sink, and asked him to re-route some switches and plugs so that the switch was in a convenient place - he did such a great job, and even put in an outlet with 4 plugs plus two USB ports for charging our phones!! I get compliments all the time about the light, and they always ask who I had put it in - CWS of course! Juan also fixed our dining room switches (there was an extra switch for some reason) and installed a dimmer, so now we can have romantic dinners at home, lol! You can't go wrong using these guys, they go the extra mile and are very good at what they do. Thanks again Juan!! Marita P A/C wasn't cooling. Called and got Kenny. Kenny said he would be here in 20-30 minutes. Guess what, Kenny was here within 20 minutes. He was honest in his findings and said he would have to return the next day due to the condition of my unit. Said he'd be back at 9am. He really showed up by 9am. Got the unit back to blowing nice and cold. I appreciate Kenny keeping his word and being there when he said he would. He gave helpful info about keeping the unit going and info about purchasing a new unit and what the install would be like. I'm thankful for his help and will definitely recommend CWS in the future. As well as call them for future servicing. AAGENHEAV WE TAKE OUR TIME AND EXPLAIN THE PROJECT TO YOU IN A SIMPLE STEP BY STEP DESCRIPTION ALLOWING YOU TO FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH OUR WORK.

What size air conditioner do I need for my Woodway home? The size of the air conditioner you need partly depends on the size of your home. For example, if you have a small home, you would not want to install a huge AC system. However, AC sizing isn’t just about the size of your Woodway home. The house’s layout, quality of insulation, and number of windows must all be considered. HVAC experts need to make careful measurements and calculations to size your new AC unit. For expert air conditioner sizing in Hewitt, contact Daily Service Co. today! Is it a problem if my Hewitt home has aluminum wiring? Probably. Old, residential aluminum wiring from the 70s and 60s is no longer considered safe. It has been found to overheat and cause fires. One solution for a home with old aluminum wiring is to replace it with copper, which is much more resilient. If you want your home checked for outdated aluminum wiring or need copper wiring installed, call 254.754.5250 to schedule a visit from one of our expert electricians. How do I know when I need to call a Daily Service Co. electrician? There are several ways to determine if your Hewitt home has electrical issues that require an electrician. If you see your lights flickering and hear buzzing from electrical components or inside the walls, you should contact a professional. Likewise, if your outlets feel warm to the touch, or if you go through light bulbs quickly, you may have electrical problems. There are many other signs of electrical problems, so please remain vigilant for anything abnormal. To get an appointment with one of our skilled electricians, please call us at 254.754.5250 .

P&E Mechanical Contractors LLC 4.9 Based on 44 reviews review us on lucas.fowler 20:28 24 Feb 23 Our business Lu and Home here in Waco hired P&E Mechanical to install HVAC systems in our retail furniture store. I can’t express how incredible their service has been. I typically am a customer who chooses a service solely on the price. I am so glad I chose to hire who I consider the best here in Waco, P&E Mechanical. The level of service and care I received from Dominic was invaluable. Ronnie, the project manager was knowledgeable, willing to help in any way he can, and has even popped by on the spot several times over the last year helping with little things that were covered under warranty. I’ll go ahead and also add, the price they quoted me was VERY competitive as well so it truly did feel like a huge win for us. I wouldn’t hire anyone else! Go with P&E! Thank you guys! Hannah Gore 23:14 28 Dec 22 P&E is the best in Waco! I have used them for years for both AVAC, new installation, and plumbing services. They have a 24 hour on call service that is quick and fast. Their employees are always very respectful and helpful when they come out to my home! They are a local business I am happy to support and recommend! Adam Alexander 13:54 05 Aug 22 I’ve used them on several issues and new systems there is nobody in the city of waco you can trust to handle your needs. I’ve been in construction for 20 years and used all different folks but i promise you, go with these guys you’ll never regret it. They have 24/7 service and better prices than anyone else Ashleigh Kelley 21:52 17 Jun 21 From beginning to end, my experience with Dominic and his team was exceptional. Their rates of installation were competitive with the market, and he worked to meet out needs by finding a unit which fit our budget and efficiency perimeters. They were prompt, courteous, thorough, and sincerely worked to educate me as the process evolved. I felt being a customer of theirs was a privilege rather than an inconvenience. I will be calling them when our next unit needs replacing! Kimberly Robinson 19:40 30 Mar 21 I honestly can't say enough good things about this company. They came highly recommended from a member of our church. They came out knowing that we may need to replace the whole unit as ours was very old. I never once felt pressured to replace the whole system. He stated he could replace fluids and get it going just right. With our unit being so old we made the decision ourselves to have them replace before summer hit. We were given an honest and fair quote for a new system and duct cleaning. They also added a new vent in my "" office"" . The crew that came out were respectful and courteous. They arrived on time and worked hard all day, even sweeping my floors after they were done to make sure they left no mess behind. I will always recommend this company to anyone and everyone. Our system is running fantastic. Our house feels so much better and the air is crisp and clean. So thankful for this company!

He is very knowledgeable, communicative and sympathetic, and I feel like I can trust him completely. I’m so glad you have such a wonderful service consultant I feel like I can rely on. Thank you all for your great service! Shari Covens Dallas, TX From the time I placed my call for service everyone I have been in contact with at Aireserv has been great! Very pleased with the service that was provided by Kevin. I am not very savvy when it comes to technical things and he explained everything that was wrong with my system in great detail. He has a great personality and highly recommend! Courtney Hill Lewisville, TX Airserv is fantastic. I've used their service twice now and saw two different technicians. You'll see many reviews mentioning Jack Theilen with good reason. The guy is prompt, professional, hard working and transparent throughout. He even casually identified and corrected a completely unrelated plumbing issue while fixing our AC - you can trust these guys with your HVAC needs. Jordon Purcell Irving, TX I have a small high school girls reunion this weekend and realized one of my guest bedrooms was not cooling down. I didn't think anyone would be able to get it taken care of inside 3 days, but Jack Theilen came out and gave us a very reasonable estimate and said he could do it immediately. Jack was so sweet and even turned around one of our return vents that wasn't related to the project. He enlarged an existing return and installed a larger supply. The difference is amazing and I am so relieved! Highly recommend this company and especially Jack! Amanda Campbell Dallas, TX Lack of Maintenance After a successful air conditioning unit installation, investing in regular maintenance is vital to prevent minor issues from getting out of hand. A trained technician can assess crucial components, such as filters and coils, ensuring efficiency, cost-savings, and durability. If you ignore regular care, it can lead to severe damage and costly air conditioner replacement emergencies. Electrical Problems Another sign you need professional air conditioning repair in Flower Mound is frequent electrical issues. The most common electrical issue is short cycling, which is a result of poor installation, power surges, or age. Look out for telltale signs of damage, such as flickering lights or dysfunctional controls, and call a trusted HVAC company in Flower Mound. Refrigerant Leaks Refrigerant levels in your AC determine system efficiency and overall performance. Although leaks can go undetected for long, regular inspections can identify minor signs of refrigerant leaks before things worsen. A severe leak can affect unit performance, leading to poor air quality and a premature air conditioner replacement in Flower Mound. Could Your System’s Thermostat Be the Problem? Sometimes, AC-related issues are caused by the thermostat. Whether due to an electrical dysfunction or incorrect settings, your thermostat can compromise the comfort of your living and working spaces. Fortunately, there are preventive measures you can take to avoid inconveniences with the thermostat, such as resetting it to default or changing the batteries to fix minor issues. In case of serious problems, consider upgrading to a programmable thermostat to save time and money in the long run. DIY vs. Professional AC Repair: Which One Is Better? Homeowners often attempt DIY AC repair in Flower Mound to save money. While you may fix minor issues through DIY solutions, complex projects like air conditioner replacement or installation should be left to trained professionals. Unlike untrained individuals, professional technicians can handle dangerous components like electrical wiring and refrigerant safely. In addition, experts leverage specialized equipment and skills to handle all your needs effectively and quickly. From the initial diagnosis to repairs and routine maintenance, you can rely on professionals to handle all the heavy lifting seamlessly. Are You Looking for Professional AC Repair and Maintenance? After a successful installation, investing in regular inspections and air conditioner repair in Flower Mound is crucial.

Our breathing allergies have disappeared. Everyone at Rutty and Morris were professional and courteous and made us feel that we were their most important customers. Chad Rutty, one of the owners, went the extra mile to help us and provided excellent information to make sure we selected the correct AC system for our home. Special thanks to Tristan and Jacob who installed our unit this week. Special thanks also to all of the Rutty and Morris team who helped us this spring and summer. By the way, this is our third AC system in 20 years. We have never had a cool home in our hot summers until now. We discovered we had been sold systems in the past that were too small for our home.

Donna S Just reviewed my estimate/proposal for the duct repairs needed from Rutty and Morris and it’s the most fair estimate I’ve ever received as a homeowner to date. Today I had an appointment scheduled with them and the technician came out. Due to my situation, and the fact that he wasn’t sure how to help me, he just did a cancellation and I wasn’t charged. A few hours later Chad Rutty came to my home himself and we discussed the best route for me moving forward. In just a few more hours, I received my estimate from him in my email inbox. I can’t say enough about this local business. They could have charged me for the technicians time. I’m so grateful that they didn’t, especially this close to Christmas. They saved my system this summer when I called for servicing. I thought I needed coolant and suspected a leak since the AC wasn’t cooling the home and it kept freezing up and shutting down. Come to find out, another local company that had serviced my system in the Spring had overfilled, which was causing over pressuring of system. They could have just told me they filled it and charged me for coolant but instead, they were honest about the issue and just drained out the extra. They came out about 2 years ago and discussed some issues I was having and suggested a fix that I could do until I was ready financially to put money into the HVAC system, as well as a few other options I had for upgrades. A lot of businesses are out for money. Being a female homeowner, I’ve found that more times than not, I’m given a line of BS with a hefty price tag attached. Not with these guys though. As long as they are in business, I will use them. Honestly and fairness is huge to me. They have been my little glimmer of hope during all of this TPC explosion mess!!! Amanda W Never have to worry about anything when Rutty & Morris is involved. Josh T I had to have duct work done and the team at Rutty & Morris was amazing. From the first phone call into the ladies in the office that are friendly. Jose that came out to give me a bid was punctual and very professional. Colin and his crew that did the work were great! They also were punctual, proficient, knowledgeable and highly trained. I highly recommend them!! Amy S They repaired our unit & serviced our outside unit. Works great Bart C Great service! Friendly people! Mike P My experience was great, when in need, they were there in a no time to troubleshoot and repair George B 5 star Kevin was very informative, professional, along with a very nice, pleasant friendly attitude! Excellent A/C Technician. I would absolutely recommend Rutty and Morris based on very quick response Same day service , friendly receptionist and Kevin that represented the company. Melody L Have always been my go to reliable source for AC work. Tylar Y Chilling in the new AC gotta love it ! Michael L Love these people! Crystal H On a Friday afternoon fan motor & module went out. Had us fixed up in under 2 hrs. Excellent job. Bart C Brent Crow did a very good job; was on time, courteous, informative….very professional! David C Jimmy Caswell did amazing. Very professional and easy to get along with. Doug M Very professional Elton Jimmy called to let me know he was on his way. He answered all my questions and was very efficient. Camille J Very professional work. Got a filtration system and air scrubber to clean my air. No more allergies Katie Exceptional service and knowledge of equipment. Jason P Very courteous, professional service John O I called to get a technician out to check on our ice make at On Stage Hair Design and was told someone would be out Friday afternoon. Within a few hours, a technician arrived. He was friendly and fixed our issue quickly. Carrie F Hometown Heroes!! 24/7 Service with a smile! Good guys, great prices! Emma L By far, the most straightforward and professional HVAC team I have ever worked with. After getting the run around from Fidelity Home Warrenty Company, these guys have set me straight in 24 hours. Charlotte C Unit had a hiccup in October. Tech came out to diagnos. Unit works as should. Tech tells me the problem, but long wait for the board to come in. Winter comes & goes. Unit quit 6/12. Called 6/13 9:30 a.m. tech arrived at 4 p.m. with parts. All they needed was a signature. All of the employees I’ve encountered from estimates to repairs have all been respectful, & actually clean up after themselves very well. Chris M They came out two weeks ago fixed our air conditioner then today one of the capacitors blew up . They came out repaired the damage replaced the capacitor and off he went!!!! They were fast and easy to work with. Rachel B Excellent service, professional and knowledgeable techs and good response times. I have use them. We have never used Rutty and Morris but we had an air conditioning issue and the technician was out here in less than a few hours. He very quickly and efficiently found and fixed our problem in a most professional way!! We will certainly recommend them to anyone we know!! Thank you Rutty and Morris!! Andy Dean C Excellent job. Workers were cordial and hard working all day long. David S The installation technicians (Steve & Johnathan) were very professional with the installation of the A/C and Heating units, clean up, safety and protection of home flooring. James Tomplait J Rutty Air Conditioning is extraordinary. I normally don’t do business recommendations because very few meet my high expectations. I’m a perfectionist and expect the same for my money. Chad Rutty is amazing and went far beyond what most other business owners would do. 2,000 miles away, with renters in my Groves, TX home, I called him and said my a/c was out. In the middle of a heat wave, he dropped everything and immediately went to restore air for the third time in three years. My a/c unit was original to my home, built in 1998. Rutty has kept it running for me, but we decided it was time to replace the unit rather that feeding money into a 24 year old unit. I’m still 2,000 miles away and couldn’t even get a check to him. He trusted me to pay him, and didn’t let the family in my home suffer for a day. His service is exemplary. Tammy T Very professional and on time which is hard to find .Worked quietly and efficiently and stayed below the quoted bid. Wes C I recently had both of my HVAC units replaced with the Daikin units recommended by two of my friends. What a great product and price with a12 year parts and labor warranty. During installation one of the units had a software issue which was corrected by Chad immediately. The other unit was installed with no issues. Both units were installed in a day and a half. Technicians were very professional and knowledgeable. They addressed every question we had. I can’t tell you everything I want to on this review but I recommend Chad and his team for any of your needs. Thanks Rutty & Morris Hoot Landry Richard L Rutty and Morris is a great AC company.The Daikin Fit Chad Rutty sold me is the real deal smart AC it sends monthly diagnostic to my email letting me know how it perform that month, it also come with a 12 year parts and labor warranty .For all your AC and Heating needs give Rutty and Morris a call… Gregory W They just replaced the outdoor unit, furnace, and the coils. They also added in a return air for my upstairs with a whole house filtration system and air scrubber. Last night was the first “cold” night in our house. The office, managers, and all installers were extremely helpful and professional. Highly recommend these guys. Cory P Rutty & Morris was amazing! They were quick, efficient, responsive, on time, and very professional. I would 100% use again and as a Real Estate Agent will be happy and comfortable referring them to clients in the future. Give them a call! Kayla K Swift response on the weekend, polite and professional staff. I’m very happy with their service Amanda J Rutty & Morris were very professional and got the job done on time! They put a new A/C unit at my office and house and had the best price around. Will definitely use them again and highly recommend them! Chris A They were able to come out within 2 hours and diagnosed the problem and had it fixed in half an hour. Very thankful as I was due home from vacation the next day. Will always use Rutty & Morris from here on out. Deanne S Made a call at 8:00am to schedule service……Will was able to troubleshoot some issues that where corrected and got unit back on line!!! Top notch work and service!!! Thank you Will!!! Taylor R Chad Rutty and crew are number 1! Always fair and reasonable. Todd Z 5 stars…most definitely!! These people know their stuff when it comes to A/C installation. The job was very well done…all ductwork and seams sealed and replaced as needed, and the new components sized perfectly to our home. The best technicians in the business. I would definitely recommend them to anyone needing a/ c work! Joseph C Very much enjoyed “Jimmy”,Grate troubleshooter. Ronald H I have a maintenance contract with R & M. Kevin was out today to check the heat side of my system. As promised, at the appointed time, he called me to to say he was on his way to my home. He checked the system & thermostat & then explained his findings. Personable, knowledgeable & professional!! I highly recommend Rutty & Morris for HVAC repair or replacement. Mike H These guys take care of their customers. Will did a great job, discussed issues a the fix and performed my maintenance. Got us up quickly. He was knowledgeable, respectful and through Terry B Technicians are very knowledgable and prompt. Toby G Prompt service and kind people. C D We had been having a problem with our AC unit every 2 months for the last year or so. We’ve only been in our home for 2 years. I have American Home Shield Warranty so I always would call them, they would send a technician out. They NEVER took the time to listen or figure out what was the problem!! Long story short. This time we decided to just go out on a limb && call Rutty && Morris. I’ve called them two times before after hours(on a Friday) when the technician AHS a",15000.0,

The technician they sent to our house was Ed. He was AWESOME!!!! Got the unit looked at and running again in no time!! We loved him!! He worked very fast and was very professional! I hope he is the one who comes out if we ever need to use your company again. Thank you guys!! And a big thank you to Mr. Ed!!!! Ray W.      Via Facebook It was the weekend hot and humid and my A/C goes out. I called Batjer and in less than an hour they are knocking on my door. they looked at my system and said my fan was going out and needs replaced. The part I needed was not in stock so they found a fan that could hold me over till they could get the right one. Monday came and so did Batjer with my new fan. Everything they did was spot on. Trent W.      Via Google We had Batjer install a Lennox variable heat pump system in July 2020. It has been great so far. After having the new system installed for a couple of months, we have noticed a massive drop in our power bill. It's been at least $100 a month less when compared to the same bill from last year. ... The giant leap in energy efficiency between our old and new systems translated into massive savings on our power bill in our specific case. I would recommend them if you want a quality job done right. Nancy H      Via Google Batjer is one of the best companies I’ve ever worked with. The service they offer is fast, responsive, and extremely competent. I recommend Batjer without reservation! They’re great. I would recommend them if you want a quality job done right.

READ MORE REVIEWS Air Duct Repair in Cedar Park, TX 78613 January 11, 2024 “I cannot say enought about this company and the team that did the work for us. I had a gas dryer vent issue that recurrently clogged because of improper installation 4 years ago. Richard was thorough and accurate in his assessment of a permanent solution to a recurring problem. Good explanations on the three options complete with cost estimates. When I selected an option and awarded the work, the team scheduled the repairs within the week. The team treated my home as if it was their own. They came promptly as scheduled and were efficient in completing the work. Richard even called to make sure about a detail later in the same day they did the work. The price was fair and reasonable compared to the other quotes which would not have resolved the design problem Richard found and fixed. This company is 5 star all around. DRHVAC is the most professional contract team I have had the pleasure to work with.” - Julie P. Gas Furnace Repair in Leander, TX 78641 December 8, 2023 “I can not say enough about this company and the amazing work that they do. Richard has been our service technician and has always gone above and beyond to make sure everything was done correctly. Believe me we had a challenging system that was installed many years ago by another company/ installer. Richard figured everything out and the system has been running flawlessly.” - Charles G.

"" We recently had both air conditioners replaced in our 12-year-old 2 story home. We had several Air Conditioning companies provide us with bids to replace the units. While I was getting over the ""sticker shock"" a friend suggested Platinum Air. Jeff, the person that came out to give us a quote, was so thorough and knowledgeable about the do's and don'ts about home Air Conditioning that we went with them. I have to say that I couldn't be more pleased! The installation crew arrived on time and were ready to go. They installed the new equipment and took the old away. They left the area clean and tidy. When the system was started up, the Technician walked us through the entire set up. He took the time to show us special features of the controls; some of which we would have never even thought of using. The control is a Wi-Fi-based control which provides us many options. By the time the Technician left, we were very comfortable with the controls. The humidity and temperature are controlled so much better than with our old unit and the utility bill is now lower. I would recommend this company to anyone without reservation."" Dave "" They have serviced my home A/C unit for over 8 years, and I am always impressed by their level of professionalism. They are always quick to respond, and I know they will get the job done right. "" EZ "" Spring is here and of course our AC went out in the middle of the night. We called them on a recommendation from a friend in the morning and they came out right away and fixed our air conditioner. Best AC repair company in Austin in my honest opinion. "" Courtney "" Such a great company to work with. They are always courteous, professional and get the job done quickly. If you need air conditioning repair, I highly recommend these guys! Thanks for your help! "" Karen Air Conditioning Service Austin, TX You can count on us to keep you comfortable all year long.

Will come back and let you know i expect it to be much lower. *** Bill is much lower. Had a part go out 4 years later and he was quick to replace.

Featured Manufacturer Our Happy Clients Says TG Johnson      “ We used them last year for a new Trane and they were great. They did an excellent job protecting our home and the AC works great. Today we called for a service call on an older Trane and they sent a 20 year employee. He got us back up and running for a very reasonable service call. These guys are trustworthy and the kind of people you want working on you home. ” Christopher Vogel      Alief Ultra did a fantastic job in a compressed time frame replacing our old damaged HVAC ducts and mixing box with a brand new up to code duct system. Professional and friendly, they were able to explain each step as they progressed through the removal and installation process. They cleaned the return air box and resealed it as a final touch to protect the intake system. Terrific job. I will be contacting them again when we begin investigating installation of a new system. Steve      Jeremy has given me the best customer service for over 10 years. He is always pleasant, honest, kind, and is very knowledgeable. Jeremy patiently answers my questions and looks out for my best interests. Service: A/C system maintenance M Wilson      Every house we have ever owned in the Houston area, we have had Alief/Ultra maintain and service our heating and air conditioning. We have been a loyal customer for over 15 years and John has been so easy to work with. He is very knowledgeable and has saved us a few times when we had urgent issues. Also, I would highly recommend the service plan program as it has been a great value to us and has assured that our heating and AC systems are always tuned and ready. Thomas Temple      These folks gave us great service at a very reasonable price. Our AC had stopped working and two other companies looked at it and wanted to sell us on a total replacement for 5,000 to 6,000 dollars without finding (or at least telling us) what the problem was. It took Mike about 20 minutes to find a leak in our outside coil and we had it replaced for $1,650. We are retirees on Social Security and couldn't afford a total system replacement. The whole experience with the owner, Mike, the office manager, Anne, and the technicians, Ron and Sam, was positive and I recommend Alief Heating & Air Conditioning without reservation.",4223.0,

See Our Reviews From Google Oscar, and his company are wonderful to do business with, he came highly recommended from a friend of mine. When we first called him he came out and advised us what we should do and gave us several options. He and his crew installed 2 new A/C units in our house in 1 day. Outside of regular maintenance issues, they have worked beautifully in the 3 years we've had them. He always answers or returns calls and is quick to offer solutions.... Micky Thompson Jul 17, 2022 Oscar came out to evaluate the system and determined the fan motor in the furnace needed to be replaced. We decided to go ahead and move forward and place the order for the part. Oscar did a great job after the part arrived installing it and getting us back up and running. He was professional, knowledgeable and courteous. The only negative was how long the part took to come in but that wasn't necessarily their fault. I can't really speak to pricing because our AC unit is a high-end unit so the parts are naturally more expensive. Overall it was a great experience and I will definitely call them again if any repairs come up. I would also recommend them to anyone asking for recommendation. Adam Morris Mar 17, 2021 Best service I've received in a long time, Oscar N. is very professional and knowledgeable. The team work fast, neat and got the work done!!!!!! in my book they get a 10+.

Here’s why residents of Houston, Richmond, Stafford, Sugar Land and the surrounding Texas areas hire us: Read More About Us Join Our Team Proudly Serving Greater Houston, TX with Expert HVAC System Services Sun Air Conditioning was founded in 1973 by Jim and Jeanette Mazurkiewicz. Initially, the company operated as a home-based business, using a rented boat stall to store parts and equipment. In 1983, Richard S.—Sun Air’s most loyal and tenured service technician— joined Jim and Jeanette to help serve their growing client base. Thank you, Richard! By the early 1990s, Sun Air had expanded into a small shop in Stafford and began hiring additional team members to support the business’s growth. In 2004, following the passing of the now-late Jeanette Mazurkiewicz, son-in-law Art O. joined the team as operations manager, propelling the business forward and continuing the legacy of service that Jim, Jeanette, and Richard had established nearly 30 years earlier. In 2018, son-in-law Rusty S., our general manager and a licensed TDL contractor, joined the team and further refined our business system – enhancing the quality and reliability of the HVAC systems and services we provide. From the beginning, Sun Air Conditioning & Heating has been firmly committed to the principles of integrity, hard work, exceptional customer service, and dependable air conditioning and heating solutions.

They confirmed and kept me updated as to their arrival. Never have I seen a plumber dressed as well and so polite and professional as Rubin. He looked at my problem, gave me price and did an outstanding job. Then, he asked to check the rest of the plumbing and gave me a recommendation of its condition. I will surely use Bannisters Plumbing again without hesitation!â â Bill R. âRandy was very professional and knowledgeable and easy to work with. The gas plumbing he installed looks great. This was my first experience using Bannister and I am more than pleased. Bannister will be my first consideration for future plumbing projects.â â James R. â12 year old hot water heater started leaking last night. Called Bannister this morning and tech was out this afternoon with a new one. Installed it and brought everything up to code. Very pleased and reasonable charges. Actually gave us two options and explained positive and negative of both. They increased the warranty from 7 to 10 years in-house. First time I can remember getting added warranty.â â Felix E.

Such a great group of people! – Jennifer Harrrison Blum Outstanding company! Reliable technicians and phenomenal service. Would definitely use again and recommend to friends! – Harrison Patrick Murphy Wichita Falls, TX James Lane Co. recently installed a new complete HVAC system for me. At first, I thought I would get a bid from them along with some others, figuring from what I had heard that they would be the highest. I got a bid from another reputable company in town and James Lane. James Lane beat the other bid, and their estimator Rob took the time to complete the bid on site and was willing to answer any questions and concerns. The other company spent about five minutes and e-mailed me a vague quote with no follow up. The installation was completed in one day, very professionally, with courteous and knowledgeable installers. I also get a free one year service plan included in the competitive pricing. I highly recommend James Lane. – Patrick Read all reviews See Our Specials To help make your dreams of owning a modern, reliable and energy efficient heating and cooling system a reality, and to help improve system performance and longevity, we offer periodic specials and coupons on a variety of different products and services.

Recognizing when you need furnace repair in Flower Mound No heat No heat when you adjust your thermostat. Your furnace might not start or starts without producing warmth. Could be ignition problems, thermostat issues, or safety lockouts. Whatever the cause, no heat needs professional attention. Short cycling Short cycling where your furnace starts and stops frequently. This behavior indicates safety controls activating or thermostat problems. Could be flame sensors, overheating, or airflow issues. Cycling problems signal failures needing repair. Unusual smells Unusual smells during operation. Burning odors might mean dust combustion or electrical problems. Gas odors near your furnace need immediate attention. Musty smells suggest ductwork issues. Persistent unusual smells need investigation. Weak airflow Weak airflow from vents even when furnace runs. Reduced airflow means blower problems or restrictions. Could be motor failure, belt issues, or severe filter clogging. Your furnace can’t heat effectively without proper airflow. Rising heating bills Increasing heating bills without explanation.

From accurate diagnosis to quality repairs to system verification, we deliver complete solutions that get your home warm again. Comprehensive diagnostic assessment Our furnace repair service begins with thorough diagnostic procedures that identify the exact cause of your heating problems. Unlike companies that guess or replace parts unnecessarily, we use systematic testing methods and specialized equipment to pinpoint failures precisely. For gas furnaces, our diagnostics include checking ignition systems, verifying gas pressure, testing limit switches, measuring voltage to electrical components, and inspecting heat exchangers for damage. This detailed approach ensures we find the true problem, not just obvious symptoms. Electric heating systems receive equally thorough evaluation, including element testing, sequencer verification, and control system diagnostics. Our technicians are trained to work with all heating types, from conventional furnaces to heat pumps and hybrid systems common in Flower Mound homes. Our service area extends throughout North Texas, and we provide the same expert diagnostic approach and quality repairs for professional furnace repair for Keller residents as we do for Flower Mound homeowners. Expert repair execution Once we’ve identified your system’s problem, our technicians perform precise repairs using quality replacement parts that meet or exceed manufacturer specifications. We stock our service vehicles with components for most common repairs, allowing same-day restoration of heating in many cases. Neighboring Southlake residents benefit from this same service excellence with our professional furnace repair for Southlake , delivered with identical speed and expertise. Our repair technicians follow detailed manufacturer procedures for each system type, ensuring repairs are performed correctly the first time. Our repair technicians follow detailed manufacturer procedures for each system type, ensuring repairs are performed correctly the first time. This attention to technical details prevents repeat failures and ensures your heating system operates as designed after our service. We bring this same level of commitment and same-day service capability to homeowners throughout the region, including furnace repair in Double Oak and surrounding North Texas communities. For complex repairs requiring specialized parts, we expedite ordering and coordinate prompt follow-up installation once components arrive. During extreme cold periods, we can often provide temporary heating solutions while waiting for backordered parts to arrive. Whether serving Flower Mound residents or providing furnace repair in Lantana , our fully-stocked service vehicles and commitment to same-day parts availability ensure your heating system downtime remains minimal regardless of your location. Safety verification procedures Safety remains our top priority during every furnace repair, particularly for gas-fired systems where proper operation directly impacts your family’s wellbeing. After completing repairs, we conduct comprehensive safety checks including carbon monoxide testing, proper venting verification, and safety control function testing. For electric heating systems, we verify proper amperage draw, check all electrical connections for tightness, and confirm proper thermostat control after repairs. These safety procedures provide peace of mind that your system not only works effectively but operates safely. Many Flower Mound homeowners are surprised by the thoroughness of our safety verification process—but this attention to detail explains why our repair work has such an outstanding reliability record throughout the community. Residents throughout North Texas, including those in need of professional furnace repair in nearby Lewisville , benefit from our same commitment to accurate diagnostics, quality parts, and comprehensive safety inspections. System performance optimization Beyond fixing the immediate problem, our repair service includes adjustments that optimize your system’s overall performance. We check air filtration, verify proper air flow, adjust gas pressure if needed, and calibrate thermostat operation to ensure your heating system delivers maximum comfort efficiently. These optimization procedures often produce noticeable improvements in heating performance and comfort distribution throughout your home. Many customers report that their systems perform better after our repairs than they did even before problems developed. We extend this comprehensive optimization approach to all communities we serve, including our furnace repair services in Argyle , where homeowners receive the same performance-focused attention to detail. For systems with significant wear or age-related efficiency decline, we provide honest assessments of remaining useful life and suggestions for improving performance within the constraints of your existing equipment. Clear operation instructions After completing repairs, we take time to explain what was wrong, how we fixed it, and how to prevent similar problems in the future. This educational approach helps you understand your heating system better and recognize early warning signs of developing issues. For repairs involving control systems or programmable thermostats, we provide clear operating instructions and programming assistance that helps you maximize both comfort and efficiency. This attention to customer education distinguishes our repair service from companies that simply fix problems without explanation. Many Flower Mound customers particularly appreciate this instructional aspect of our service, telling us they feel more confident about their heating systems after understanding the repairs performed and how their systems should properly function. Repair warranty protection Every furnace repair we perform comes with a comprehensive warranty on both parts and labor. This protection gives you confidence that our repair solutions will last—and if any related issues develop, we’ll make it right without additional charges. Our warranty coverage exceeds industry standards because we stand behind our repair work completely.

I have owned and operated several successful 5 star service businesses, so I am always looking for the best value when searching for a company to hire… Dorian Currier Felix is so great to work with on HVAC issues. We had to reschedule because of rain and he communicated the whole time. I would highly recommend him for all HVAC issues. Lindsey Walston Felix responded quickly yesterday when I had a relatively new A/C unit stop working. He showed up on time and quickly diagnosed my unit, recognizing it was the fan on the outside of the house. Still under warranty, he is ordering a new motor and scheduling it immediately… Jack Leech III By far the best in the area! He was on time and friendly. Felix was happy to help and very knowledgeable. He explained everything to us and was just all around helpful. I will be a lifelong customer. Kat Prompt response to initial request for service even though it was a Saturday afternoon. Felix attempted to fix the issue but discovered that it was unrepairable. He put together a couple of options/quotes on Monday morning and his team … Michelle Miller Felix is the best. Hands down would recommend his team for your AC needs. Great guys. They take care of you Jared Clementz 1st, the promptness of answering my call! Felix missed my call, and before I could leave a message was already calling me back! He advised he could come out the next day between 9-12p and gave me a quote for the service call and a rough estimate of what my total could be… Jana Zelenka-Reed Felix is a consummate professional. He lets you know when he’ll arrive, DOES arrive, and evaluates the problem. If nothing is needed, he will let you know has never upcharged, oversold or under performed in his work. If any HVAC work is needed we don’t hesitate to call Fix It Felix. Anna Oakley The fear of your A/C going out in the middle of the summer is a stressful thought… and of course ours did. Felix was very kind and friendly smile. That really help put me at ease. He was very patient will all my questions. Took the time to explain about preventive maintenance. Jon Bunn Félix is one of the best service professionals I have worked with. He took care of our problem quickly and was extremely friendly. He even took the time to answer all of my kids questions as well haha! You can definitely trust Felix to take care of any issues you have… Tanner F Felix was available on short notice in August. On time. Knows the job and included a cleaning after the outside unit was fixed for one price. Friendly, great service. Saving in my phone for future. Keith Duffner Felix is fantastic. He came by less than 24 hours after we called him to take a look at our AC. He was able to quickly problem shoot and remedy our situation. Highly recommend! Evan Barger Felix was awesome. Came an hour earlier than quoted (same day, was here 2.5 hours after I called) and fixed my AC/charged up my Freon in less than an hour. Prices were reasonable and he didn’t try to just sell me a new unit. House is already cooler which is a feat at noon in this heat and humidity. Haleigh Carr We have to say we were EXTREMELY grateful for both the timeliness and quote we got from Felix. Felix was professional, punctual, and quick to fix our AC unit. He even serviced our unit and checked our filters. Paul Perez Leave a Review Add a review: Name Email Review Rating COMFORT GUARANTEED Lets Talk! Ready to elevate your home's comfort?

FAQ What is the proper size HVAC system for my home? Sizing the equipment load requires the consideration of several factors. Ceiling height, construction, window size, placement, and dozens of other variables need to be considered to properly size a heating and/or cooling system. A professionally conducted load calculation is the foundation of an effective system. Should I perform preventative maintenance? Heating and cooling systems work incredibly hard to perform their functions for your household. The constant stopping, starting and continual operation can wear down a machine quickly and unexpectedly if the proper care and maintenance are delayed. However, by performing preventive maintenance, or servicing your system regularly, you can maximize the life-cycle of your heating or cooling unit and guard against many unexpected failures. Preventive maintenance inspections performed on a regular basis can uncover leaks, rust, rot, soot, frayed wires, and corroded electrical contacts. Do you offer financing? YES! We offer low, affordable monthly payments provided by FTL Finance that range from 24-84 months. We can customize a plan that will fit your budget. For further details & information on how to apply, please call 1-800-981-9032. Reference dealer ID #C212810. How often should my AC be serviced? We recommend having your AC serviced at least once a year, ideally before the summer heat sets in. Regular maintenance can prevent breakdowns, improve efficiency, and ensure your system is ready to handle the season’s demands. Are your technicians certified? Absolutely! Our technicians are not only certified but also continuously trained in the latest HVAC technologies and practices. We take pride in the expertise and professionalism of our team. Do you offer emergency repair services? While we focus on scheduled services, we understand that some situations require prompt attention. Please call us to discuss your needs, and we’ll do our best to accommodate urgent requests during our operating hours. Can you help with improving indoor air quality? Yes, improving indoor air quality is one of our specialties. We offer solutions ranging from air purifiers to duct cleaning services to ensure you breathe clean, healthy air in your home. What areas do you serve? We proudly serve the Denton and Fort Worth areas, ensuring our neighbors enjoy optimal indoor comfort year-round.",9220.0,

Excess moisture: High humidity levels can lead to mold growth and discomfort. This could be caused by a clogged condensate drain line or an inefficient system. Strange noises: Grinding, banging, or screeching noises can indicate failing components like compressors or motors. Rising energy bills: If your energy bills are skyrocketing, there could be an underlying issue like refrigerant leaks or inefficient operation. Frequent repairs: If your system seems to need constant repairs, it might be time for a replacement.
