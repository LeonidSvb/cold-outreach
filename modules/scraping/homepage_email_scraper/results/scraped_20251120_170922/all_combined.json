The food is made fresh when ordered. Lovely variety of menu items - both veg and non-veg (menu uploaded) An extremely clean and hygenic place. We received our order pretty quickly and the portions were generous. The chef Shyam is extremely professional and extended warm hospitality. The only downside is that the shop itself is located at a crossing, and is smallish, so anythn more than 2-3 mid-sized groups would be a tad much. The good thing is that the wraps are perfect for take-out. Overall - definitely recommend.” Vinita Sean Rodrigues arrow icon bottom of page",

Downloadable(s) Download this content as PDF close History Huddart Parker was a Melbourne based shipping company which ran services between Australia and New Zealand. They had offices on Post Office Square, in Queen’s Chambers (so named for its proximity to Queens Wharf) from 1893. Prior to this the site was occupied by the Pier Hotel, built on land reclaimed by the Provincial Government between 1857 and 1863. Queen’s Chambers were damaged by fire in 1923 the building was later demolished (“wrecked to ground level”), along with T. & W. Young’s warehouse next door in Jervois Quay and, in their place, a new building was constructed for Huddart Parker in 1924. It was designed by Crichton, McKay and Haughton and built by Mitchell and King and opened in February 1925. Huddart Parker became one of the key players in the trans-Tasman shipping trade, a major rival of the Union Steam Ship Company of New Zealand. Huddart, Parker & Co. Ltd was founded in 1876 in Geelong by James Huddart, T.J. Parker, John Traill, and Captain T. Webb. James Huddart’s uncle, Captain Peter Huddart made his fortune as a coal merchant for use in the Victorian goldfields in the 1850s and T.J. Parker had been a merchant, shipping agent and (later) ships owner in Geelong from circa 1853. The company was successful and by 1882 had established a service between Melbourne and Sydney and by 1886 ran another between Melbourne and Adelaide. In the 1890s the shipping company covered the principal ports in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania, with a route to New Zealand established in 1893. Wellington was selected as the location for a New Zealand Headquarters, and the company operated from No.3 Queen’s Chambers. The company ran the steam ship Tasmania on a route from Auckland to Napier, Wellington, Lyttleton and Sydney every three weeks from December 1893, and other routes followed thereafter. Huddart Parker also operated the Australia, New Zealand and Canada mail route for many years from 1893, and it seems likely that the New Zealand to Australia shipping route was established so as to secure government subsidies for the Canada mail run. One of their ships, the Wanganella, was involved in one of most protracted and famous ship groundings in the history of the port of Wellington, after it ran on to Barrett’s Reef on 19 January 1947. The Wanganella had earlier been requisitioned as an Australian Hospital Ship and served in the Middle East, New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Borneo and the South Pacific and it was ironic that she ran into Barrett’s Reef on her maiden voyage after the war. The stranded boat became a major local attraction until, three weeks later, completely stripped of its cargo and fuel, it was finally hauled off the rocks. The company’s repair and salvage costs were substantial. Huddart Parker Ltd was taken over by Bitumen and Oil Refineries of Australia Limited in 1961, but though the company no longer exists the Huddart Parker building still bears its name. The building was substantially refurbished between 1987 and 1990. Until the 2000s it was well known as the headquarters of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union. The (1963) combined clock and temperature display on top of the building was also once a familiar inner-city landmark. The display was said to be the first “weather forecast in lights” for New Zealand and was operated from the meteorological office. The display used a pattern of 1.5m high lights to create the words “fine”, “cloudy”, “rain”, “change” or “gale” and the latter was chosen in “recognition of Wellington’s peculiar needs.” The display, which was designed to be read from the Wellington Railway Station, also showed the time in hours, minutes and seconds. It was noted that although Auckland had a sign that displayed the time, Christchurch one that displayed the weather forecast and Dunedin one that displayed the temperature and the time, Wellington’s was the only one that was linked to an official source such as the Met Office. The weather forecast in lights was reminiscent of an earlier Provincial Observatory and adjacent Time Ball. The Time Ball was used to recalibrate ship’s chronometers which in turn were used during journeys to establish longitude, an essential requirement for navigation. The Provincial Observatory was established in 1863 and used to take astronomical, meteorological and climatological readings. Both the Customhouse and Provincial Observatory were located at Queen’s Wharf, very close to the future site of the Huddart Parker Building. The Huddart Parker building is now owned by the Fruitgrower’s Charitable Trust who plan to refurbish and strengthen the building with a proposed completion date of 2013.

Occupation History close Not assessed close Architectural Information Building Classification(s) close Not assessed Architecture close The Huddart Parker building is a good example of what has become known as the Chicago style. The design follows Louis Sullivan’s dictum that a building should have a base, trunk and be properly capped. The two-storey base, comprising the ground and first floors, is quite traditional in design. Heavily rusticated, it has a balustraded hood over the main entrance, a plain entablature, and small balconies supported by consoles at second-floor level in the centre and at both ends of the building. A plain cornice separates this base from the four-storey shaft above. The shaft is more transitional in appearance. Plain and unadorned, with a regular hierarchy of single, paired or triple windows, the shaft exploits the new steel-frame technology that allowed a greater ratio of window to wall area. A horizontal emphasis is present on the facade, balancing the vertical, and giving a sense of proportion and harmony to the building. A pronounced cornice divides the shaft from the building’s seventh-floor “crown”. This crown is capped by a dentilled cornice and a shallow stepped parapet. Balconies repeat the design and placement of those on the third floor. The building is sparely ornamented, with most of its feature deriving from the composition of the key architectural elements – the rusticated base, strong pattern of windows and the small balconies and prominent cornice lines. This gives the building an elegant formal quality. The most important façade is that to Grey Street which contains the main entrance to the building. The central three bays of the façade are brought forward of the two corner bays and the entrance is given additional prominence with an overhanging balcony at the second floor level. The exterior of the building remains largely unaltered. Materials close Reinforced concrete piles, structural frame, piers, columns, beams, floor and roof slabs. Timber ceiling joists with fibrous plaster ceilings The original drawings are faint, but the external walls appear to be constructed in reinforced concrete, and the floors to the WCs directly behind the main stair appear to be constructed with timber joists & flooring. Internal walls – reinforced concrete walls to stair, elevator, WCs and strong-rooms. Coke filled “patent coke breeze blocks” for all other partitions Entrance vestibule – marble cladding Setting close Post Office Square heritage area is a significant and popular urban open space of over 100 years standing surrounded by a group of important former harbour board and commercial buildings. The area is named for the former General Post Office (GPO), which occupied the site of the present-day Hotel Intercontinental and IBM Tower on Customhouse Quay from 1863 to 1974. The heritage area is not really a square in the conventional sense but it is an open, definable space at the confluence of a number of important streets, and is closely related to the establishment and use of the waterfront by the former Wellington Harbour Board (WHB). In particular, the square was, and is, the key point of access to Queens Wharf, Wellington’s most historically important wharf. The square was created partly by 19th century additions to the original 1857-63 reclamation which gave room to construct buildings on the eastern side of the square and accommodate traffic and even, for a period, a railway. A statue of Queen Victoria was placed there in 1906 (and later removed in 1911), while the island was formed in 1912 to accommodate the tram shelter that later became Clarrie Gibbons. The island has grown considerably in extent since then. With a couple of notable exceptions, the square has undergone only incremental change since the early 20th century and, as a result, it has maintained its basic configuration and essential characteristics. It is, despite the presence of modern buildings on the edges, still recognisably the same place it was 100 years ago. Post Office Square is a place of high heritage value and importance to Wellington and contains a number of significant heritage buildings. It is a place very familiar to many Wellingtonians and is passed daily by thousands of people, in cars or on foot. The Post Office Square heritage area is principally an open space defined by a number of significant heritage buildings. The area includes all the buildings bounding the square – on Grey Street and Customhouse and Jervois Quays, as well as Sheds 11 and 13 to the immediate north and the nearby Wharf Offices and Bond Store buildings. The boundary follows the property lines of the key buildings surrounding the square and extends across Jervois Quay to pick up the four former WHB buildings. With one exception, all the buildings within the area boundary contribute to the formation and qualities of the square. Wharf Offices (Shed 7 \/ Wharf Office Apartments, 1896) Head Office and Bond Store (Museum of Wellington - City and Sea, 1891-92) Shed 11 (1904-05) Shed 13 (1904-05) Clarrie Gibbons Store (and traffic island, 1912) Huddart Parker Building, 2-6 Jervois Quay (1924) Tower Building, 50 – 64 Customhouse Quay (1936) Intercontinental Hotel, 2 Grey Street (1988) Todd Corporation Building, 95 Customhouse Quay, (1987) Chapman Tripp Building, 1-13 Grey Street (1976) With the exception of the latter two, these are all buildings of high heritage significance. There are a number of other features within the square and on its margins that can be considered part of the heritage area, many of which contribute to its values, including the Queens Wharf gates (1899), a heritage telephone box (c.1938) and a heritage postal box (dating from between 1879 and 1910). close Cultural Value The building is a very bold and competent example of Chicago-style architecture and was designed by Crighton, McKay and Haughton a prominent and longstanding Wellington architectural practice. The building is situated on a prominent corner site at a corner of Post Office Square and Jervois Quay and has a strong street presence particularly when view from the north. The building is part of a group of significant heritage buildings that form the Post Office Square Heritage Area, and of a group of heritage buildings that owed their existence to the nearby wharf trade. The building retains the name of Huddart Parker, a large trans-Tasman shipping company and is historically significant for being the last of the shipping industry buildings still standing alongside the waterfront. Aesthetic Value close Architectural Does the item have architectural or artistic value for characteristics that may include its design, style, era, form, scale, materials, colour, texture, patina of age, quality of space, craftsmanship, smells, and sounds?

The building is situated on a prominent corner site at a corner of Post Office Square and Jervois Quay and has a strong street presence particularly when viewed from the north. Its rooftop has long been occupied by signage, historically by an illuminated clock and weather forecast, presently by an advertisement for a local radio station and a temperature display. This signage takes advantage of the prominence of the building, particularly for passing traffic along the key transport route of Customhouse and Jervois Quays. Historic Value close Association Is the item associated with an important person, group, or organisation? The building retains the name of Huddart Parker, a large trans-Tasman shipping company and is historically significant for being the last of the shipping industry buildings still standing alongside the waterfront.

Does the item contribute to sense of place or continuity? The building façade has remained (relatively) unaltered for over 80 years and makes a strong positive contribution to the sense of place and continuity of the BNZ \/Head Office Heritage Area. Sentiment Connection Is the item a focus of community sentiment and connection? The building once held community sentiment and connection for the temperature display and clock that was a prominent feature on the roof. This has somewhat diminished since the removal of the display. Level of Cultural Heritage Significance close Authentic Does the item have authenticity or integrity because it retains significant fabric from the time of its construction or from later periods when important additions or modifications were carried out? The building exterior has had few intrusive modern alterations and additions and retains much of the authentic building fabric.

    "homepage_content":"Belgian Beer Cafe - A Tree Blog - Successfully Grow Your Fruit Trees in Auckland NZ Skip to content Menu Pruning is an essential practice in tree care that promotes healthy growth, enhances the tree’s appearance, and ensures safety by removing dead or hazardous branches. Proper pruning techniques vary depending on the type of tree and its specific needs. This article will guide you through the steps of pruning different types of trees, highlighting the importance of this practice for tree health, safety, and aesthetics. Why Prune Your Trees? Health: Regular pruning removes dead, diseased, or damaged branches, preventing the spread of disease and encouraging healthy growth. It also allows better air circulation and sunlight penetration, which are crucial for the tree’s overall health. Safety: Pruning reduces the risk of falling branches that could cause injury or property damage. It also helps maintain clearances around structures, power lines, and walkways. Aesthetics: Pruning enhances the natural shape and beauty of trees, contributing to a well-maintained and attractive landscape. When to Prune According to Tree Removal North Shore specialist Narvin who also specialise in tree pruning, The best time to prune most trees is during their dormant season, usually late winter or early spring before new growth begins. This timing minimizes stress on the tree and reduces the risk of disease and pest infestation. However, some trees, like flowering species, may require pruning immediately after they bloom. Tools You’ll Need Pruning Shears: For small branches up to ¾ inch in diameter. Lopping Shears: For branches up to 2 inches in diameter. Pruning Saw: For larger branches. Pole Pruner: For high branches that are out of reach. Protective Gear: Gloves, safety glasses, and a hard hat if necessary. Step-by-Step Pruning Guide 1. Assess the Tree Begin by examining the tree for any dead, diseased, or damaged branches. Identify branches that cross or rub against each other, as well as those that are growing inward or downward. 2. Remove Dead, Diseased, or Damaged Branches Cut these branches back to the nearest healthy branch, trunk, or main limb. Make clean cuts just outside the branch collar (the swollen area where the branch meets the trunk) to promote proper healing. 3. Thin Out Crowded Branches Selectively remove branches to allow better light penetration and air circulation. Focus on removing branches that cross or rub against each other, as well as those that grow towards the center of the tree. 4. Trim for Shape and Structure For young trees, establish a strong central leader (the main upward-growing branch) and remove competing leaders. Shape the tree to maintain a balanced, natural form. For mature trees, maintain their shape by removing any wayward or overly long branches. 5. Make Proper Cuts When removing a branch, use the three-cut method to prevent bark tearing: Make the first cut on the underside of the branch, about 6-12 inches from the trunk. Make the second cut on the top side of the branch, a few inches beyond the first cut, to remove the branch. Make the final cut just outside the branch collar to remove the remaining stub. 6. Avoid Over-Pruning Never remove more than 25% of a tree’s canopy in a single year. Over-pruning can stress the tree and make it more susceptible to disease and pests. Pruning Techniques for Different Types of Trees Deciduous Trees Prune in late winter to early spring. Focus on removing dead, diseased, and damaged branches. Shape the tree by thinning crowded branches and maintaining a balanced form. Evergreen Trees Prune in late winter or early spring before new growth begins. Remove dead or damaged branches. Lightly shape the tree by trimming back any overgrown branches. Flowering Trees Prune immediately after flowering if they bloom in spring. For summer-blooming trees, prune in late winter or early spring. Remove spent flowers and any dead or diseased branches to encourage new growth. Fruit Trees Prune in late winter or early spring while the tree is still dormant. Focus on removing any dead or diseased wood. Thin out the canopy to improve air circulation and sunlight penetration, which promotes fruit production. Final Thoughts Proper pruning is vital for the health, safety, and aesthetics of your trees. By following these steps and using the right techniques, you can ensure your trees grow strong , look beautiful, and remain safe for years to come. Regular pruning not only enhances the natural beauty of your landscape but also prevents potential hazards, making it a crucial aspect of tree care. For those unsure about tackling tree pruning themselves, consider hiring a professional arborist. They have the expertise and equipment to prune trees safely and effectively, ensuring your trees receive the best care possible. Remember, a well-pruned tree is a happy and healthy tree! … Once the most suitable fruit tree has been chosen, other equally important questions come to mind in terms of its maintenance, questions that we intend to help you solve in this article by giving you useful advice on planting, pruning, disease prevention and pests . Land preparation For the planting to be a success, it is better to be a bit proactive and a month in advance make a hole of at least 1 m in diameter and 80 cm deep, to later fill it again, taking advantage of to enrich the soil with a bottom fertilizer like worm castings. If in the first years it is going to be necessary to fix the fruit tree to a guide, it would be convenient to place the frame or tutor before filling the holes or trenches made with earth to soften the ground and improve its quality and aeration. Planting fruit trees from a pot The appropriate time for planting is the one in which there will no longer be any risks of frost that prevent sprouting and the formation of new roots. The steps to follow would be: Dig a hole slightly larger than the root ball Immerse the root ball in a container with water so that the root ball substrate is thoroughly moistened before removing it from the pot Insert the root ball at the bottom of the hole, ensuring that the top of the root ball is flush with the ground Fill the hole without tamping the dirt Make a tree hole around the trunk with a hoe and water abundantly Prune the master branches one third to balance the aerial part (crown) with the underground part (roots) Winter pruning One of the most decisive maintenance tasks in obtaining a good harvest and which is given less importance is pruning, which is very necessary in trees already established every 4 or 5 years, since it is a way to rejuvenate the tree and favor the formation of new shoots. The best time to perform this task is in November , when the tree is entering vegetative rest. Fertilization Fruit trees are one of the crops that consume the most nutrients, so in addition to making a fertilizer during the spring and the time of fruit formation with a specific fertilizer for fruit trees, a previous fertilization with abundant organic matter with manure, compost or earthworm humus, which would be applied to the foot of the tree up to the vertical of the branches, in late winter immediately before vegetative development begins. Padding A practice that will help us considerably is the application of organic mulch, a layer of at least 5 cm deep, of straw, cut grass or pine bark, which when distributed at the foot of the tree will limit the growth of weeds and it will also maintain a degree of moisture beneficial to the superficial roots.… Search for: Search Terms and Conditions - Privacy Policy",

    "homepage_content":"Italian Restaurant - Cicio Cacio Osteria Newtown Skip to content A me piacciono gli anfratti bui delle osterie dormienti, dove la gente culmina nell’eccesso del canto. A me piacciono le cose bestemmiate e leggere, e i calici di vino profondi. “I like dark crannies of sleeping osterie, where people culminate in the excess of singing. I like cursed and light things, and deep glasses of wine.\" Our Story “It was something like ten or eleven years ago. I was lost and lonely, working as a cook, living in an old motel (The Carillon) in Mount Cook in Wellington, and trying to be a writer. I didn’t have time or will for washing my clothes at the motel, so every Monday on my day off I would walk to Newtown, leave my stuff at a laundry nearby and go to have a coffee at Baobab café. There was an eatery called Manon at the back of an alleyway in front of the cafe. I would spy the restaurant from the little window thinking how cute it was. Manon eventually closed down and the place seemed to be abandoned for years. The place looked as old as it could be in Europe, and decadent and bohemian as all the things I loved. Few years went by and life took over. I married a beautiful Chilean girl who used to cook with me and call me “dictator!”, I learned to speak Spanish like a Chilean, I stopped writing bull… and I got into running some Italian kitchen in town at Mariluca first and then Ombra. Then my friend Luis who runs Viva Mexico next door, passed me the contact of the landlord of that old place in Newtown. The landlord was an old man in an old house in Oriental Bay. He loved that restaurant more than anything he had and he always dreamt to bring it back to life, before it was too late. My wife Patricia, my former business partner and I opened the place with $16.000 dollars, with a name that nobody could pronounce, going against any common sense business rules and with no much hope to survive. We started serving two lonely house made sausages on an empty plate, pouring only Italian wines, and writing menus in Italian. People thought we were nice guys, but won’t make it. And here we are, five years later, celebrating every day the same love for good people, honest food and true wines.” (Giulio Ricatti – chef patron) A CULINARY JOURNEY TO THE HEART OF ITALY... By being an “osteria” we mean that at Cicio Cacio we cook humble Italian food in a family environment. We are passionate about Italian regional cuisine and we pretend to travel the whole peninsula, researching Italian lost recipes. We change the menu every month, following a different city of Italy. If we can do something by hand we will do it, as our famous bread, pasta and sausages. Our goal is to be as authentic as it would be the food you eat at home in Italy. We try to look closer at ingredients, places, people and memories. Our language is the language of simplicity, treated with care and respect. All our dishes, wines and menus are in Italian because Italy is what our “osteria” is about. We invite you to enjoy the trip. Buon Appetito!! the art of wine As for our food, our wine list reflects our travels through Italy and our passion for mysterious and exotic grapes. As home of something like 500 different varieties, Italy is probably the most interesting wine producer in the world. We love our wines and we love our people, and we try to match the two things. Are you a student? Are you an artist? Are you an intellectual, a housewife or a businessman? Are you young or old? Man or female? Poor or rich? We try to have wines for everyone. We like wines that express Italy at its best, keeping the subject easy and democratic. As every other art (or craft) it is a simple thing, really. It is not a headache. It is a pleasure. Drink List Cicio Cacio is not only a restaurant, it is our home. We will light candles and fire, pour wine and play music. As Baudelaire would have said: “We will boil and serve our own heart”.

    "homepage_content":"Jax Burger Shack Home Our Story Order Now Contact Us FROM OUR FAMILY TO YOURS ORDER NOW ON THE MENU ORDER NOW OUR STORY It all kicked off in a quiet street in Manurewa, where our founder was flipping burgers out of a run-down fish and chip shop - and turning it into the talk of the town. They renamed the shop Smokys' Manurewa. Word spread fast, especially on social media, and soon people were cruising in from every corner of Auckland just to get a taste. After parting ways with his original business partner, our founder set out to build something truly his own. That's how Jax Burger Shack was born in 2020. These days, he's running Jax alongside his wife, keeping it a true family business, with our motto front and centre: \"Burgers from our family to yours.\" And trust us - expansion is definitely on the horizon. We're obsessed with quality, no shortcuts taken. We've got beautiful buns baked fresh for us on the regular, juicy tender patties made instore, and our own house-made aioli that takes every bite to the next level. Even our sides are cooked in rich beef tallow for that extra punch of flavour. Come hungry - your satisfaction is our priority. Because at Jax Burger Shack, we're setting the gold standard for burgers, one epic feed at a time. FOLLOW US ON SOCIALS LOCATIONS At Jax, we're all about bringing people together over seriously great food.

After spending considerable time comparing pricing for flat-packed units from Mitre 10 and Bunnings, I decided to go with a pre-assembled, professionally installed unit, and it was definitely the right choice. The quality of the unit is outstanding—every detail is meticulously crafted, and the fittings are top-notch. The delivery was prompt, arriving exactly when expected, and the installation was smooth and hassle-free. The customer service throughout the process was exceptional, with the team keeping me informed every step of the way and addressing any questions I had. I couldn’t be more pleased with my decision to invest in this unit, and I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a high-quality, well-made kitchenette. Michelle Brown | Director | REEL Direct Limited ★★★★★ We have received and installed several Kitchenettes to date for our Aged Care Facilities in the far North. Kitchenette’s save time, being delivered mostly assembled. The inclusion of appliances and pre-fitted electrical and plumbing components make life easy. My team had the kitchenettes fully assembled and in position within an hour due to pre-assembly, electrical pre-fitting and plumbing. I can fully recommend Kitchenette throughout the entire process. Paul Newman | Far North District Council ★★★★★ I needed a small kitchen area for a hair salon. The size was exactly what we needed. Manufactured and delivered in a timely fashion. I love the fact that everything was included... microwave, fridge, power points and sink with tap and plumbing\/electrical all included. Highly recommend.

Simply Indian, the original Motueka Indian restaurant We're now over 20 years old. \"I started work here 10 years ago in front of house as duty manager, and commuted from Nelson every day. I loved coming to work in Motueka and chatting with all the regulars and tourist visitors from far and wide. One day the opportunity to buy the restaurant came up and I jumped at the idea. I liked Motueka, the restaurant and its beautiful clientele so much that I bought it. And so I became the very proud owner of Simply Indian. I had just started a family and we moved to Motueka straight-away to be closer to our new venture. Two of the chefs from those days are the main stay of our kitchen still, ensuring you receive consistent quality dining every time you visit us. You might find cheaper but I'm confident you won't find better quality and taste. Thanks to everyone who dines with us, you have kept us going through the ups and downs that life throws our way.\" Sabin Lunch: 11am-2pm (5 days, Mon-Sat, closed Tuesday lunchtime) Dinner: from 5pm till late (7 days) Fully licensed & BYO - corkage fee: - $10 Great choice of vegetarian and vegan dishes Banquets & parties, dinner for two, a group of friends or a Friday shout with your work mates.

Highly recommend the pork trio ramen! Staff are super friendly and the wait time is minimal (15 mins for us). I would post a photo of the food as soon as it came out but I was so hungry that I forgot to take one! Here's a photo of a half finished ramen, but trust me when I say that it's fantastic.\" Matt from Google Review Inquire private function & venue hire here Book bottom of page",

Elephant Fish have firm white flesh with low oil content - they belong to the same group as sharks and rays so there are no bones, only cartilage. Despite the kind expression in their eyes, they won’t be coming to a Disney movie near you, specifically because of their very disturbing nose thingy. Luckily they taste better than they look! Blue Cod Blue Cod are indigenous to New Zealand and are common in colder waters South of the Cook Strait and around the Chatham Islands. The Codfather of the fish and chip world...

ORDER ONLINE NOW Customer Reviews Listen to what our customers say about us Karen âWe LOVE Aroma India. The food is always fabulous and the service friendly. The restaurant has a nice modern feel to it and does not feel crowded even when full. We are never hurried when we are there and feel that we can take our time eating. Although Iâm not a vegetarian, some of my favourite dishes are the paneer, the mushrooms and the dal makhani. I also love the Hariayala Murgh. The portions are a good size, particularly the biryanis. The chefs are very approachable and happy to show-off the kitchen.â Rob ââComing from the UK and being local in Greytown, we were very excited about a new Indian Restaurant in our town. When we tried it and found it to be consistently the best curry in New Zealand, we were blown away. We can definitely recommend our favourite dishes which are Hariayala Murgh and Malabari Fish.â Chris âWith the arrival of âAromaâ, Greytown can now boast as having the best Indian Restaurant in the Lower North Island. The ambience and style is warm and inviting, the staff always attentive friendly and happy. The menu is wide and varied but must-try dishes are the Garlic Chicken Tikka, the Hariayala Murgh, Lamb Masala and the Chicken Korma. After several visits, itâs always a great feeling that the staff recognise you and always make you feel special. Dining-in or taking-out, nothing is an issue, and home delivery is always a massive bonus on cold winter nights!! â Maureen âOne of the best Indian restaurants in the Wellington region. My husband and I go there several times a month for lunch or dinner as the menu is extensive, authentic, and the staff is exceedingly friendly and attentive. Dishes can be made to-order and Aroma has one of the best combination of spices, sauces, and fresh ingredients. An added bonus, we have taken our young Grandchildren there on occasion and they too are made to feel equally welcome. I highly recommend Aroma for anyone wanting a great Indian meal!â Colin âBefore dining at aroma india Iâd had Indian food half-a-dozen times but found its a little dry and not to my taste. We moved to Greytown 2 years ago and my wife asked me to try Aroma India. I found the restaurant to be clean and inviting, and the owner and staff pleasant and eager to chat. I now love Indian food â itâs always fresh and very tasty. My favourite is their chicken khorma (medium) with their delicious garlic naan. We like to eat there once a week. The first time we went there we asked for ice in our wine â strange but true! The second time they remembered us and asked if we would like ice! AMAZING! GREAT STAFF, GREAT FOOD.â Chelle âAroma has added some delicious spice to our life! We love trying something new each visit and appreciate being able to specify the level of spice. The hariyala murgh is delicious.â Previous Next LOCATION 74-76 Main Street, Greytown 5712, New Zealand 06 304 8080 069298209 aromaindia38@gmail.com Phone 06 304 8080, 069298209 Email aromaindia03@gmail.com Location 74-76 Main Street, Greytown 5712 ↑",

Q1 Trading Great food, friendly service! Would happily go back! Josh Lee Ilam shopping complex, is where it is located. Dining in was allowed, takeaway too. I bought two chicken shawarmas today (26\/05\/2022). Was 19$ each. It came with a salad, sauce, a whole lot of chips, and a shawarma. That was not a fair deal. A shawarma today was a bit too salty. A lot of chips does not cover up a better shawarma. That is my individual opinion. Nirosh Gamage Great food, quick service.

I have been coming here for 20+ years. I live overseas now, and every time I visit Auckland I have to come back. The absolute best kebabs. The way the meat is marinated and cut is just perfect. Delicious. Rosa A go-to place for kebabs on K-road. Great value chicken kebab on rice with garlic yoghurt, a healthy salad with nice humus as a dressing. There are plenty of options for customisation, and the service is quick and efficient. Alex Marvelous service with stunning interior. My partner and I had lunch here and everything is 5\/5. Highly recommended. Will return soon. Jayce I had an amazing experience at little Turkish cafe, Mahdi and surya were amazing help. Incredible experience best kebab I’ve ever had will recommend for all my friends and family. I love how the lamb is proper cuts of meat and not mince. Highly recommend incredible service. Vicey The vegetarian moussaka was out of this world. Awesome comfort food and the portion size was huge. I almost didn’t have room for baklava, which was delicious, too. A casual space to go have a satisfying meal. My friend got chicken skewers and commented they were cooked to perfection. S Stumbled across this awesome little cafe in Auckland during my weekend stay. We ordered the lamb on chips and a meatlovers pizza. The food was very good quality and tasted delicious. The pizza's are woodfired and it was perfectly done. The lamb on chips\/lamb snack pack was also very tasty and filling. Thank you very much! Darlo This place is great. I got stuck in Auckland for a couple of weeks and was staying nearby - this place caught my eye so went in to try. Food was really great, very tasty and a great price. I enjoyed it so much i went back again a few nights later! Would recommend all to try it. Andrew This place has become my goto Turkish eatery. In my opinion the best lamb in Auckland and the rice is cooked so perfectly fluffy. The eatery is open late and I like to bring my friends here. The team is also very friendly. Dan Absolutely beautiful meals. We had the Lamb Shish Kebab and Mixed Platter . The lamb was perfect and so delicious. Both meals flavorsome and extremely enjoyable. We both so enjoyed our meals and our time at the little Turkish café. We will be making this a regular place to eat. The service was friendly, welcoming, flawless.3 Lynette Stumbled across this awesome little cafe in Auckland during my weekend stay. We ordered the lamb on chips and a meatlovers pizza.

I have been coming here for 20+ years. I live overseas now, and every time I visit Auckland I have to come back. The absolute best kebabs. The way the meat is marinated and cut is just perfect. Delicious. Rosa A go-to place for kebabs on K-road. Great value chicken kebab on rice with garlic yoghurt, a healthy salad with nice humus as a dressing. There are plenty of options for customisation, and the service is quick and efficient. Alex Marvelous service with stunning interior. My partner and I had lunch here and everything is 5\/5. Highly recommended. Will return soon. Jayce I had an amazing experience at little Turkish cafe, Mahdi and surya were amazing help. Incredible experience best kebab I’ve ever had will recommend for all my friends and family. I love how the lamb is proper cuts of meat and not mince. Highly recommend incredible service. Vicey The vegetarian moussaka was out of this world. Awesome comfort food and the portion size was huge. I almost didn’t have room for baklava, which was delicious, too. A casual space to go have a satisfying meal. My friend got chicken skewers and commented they were cooked to perfection. S Stumbled across this awesome little cafe in Auckland during my weekend stay. We ordered the lamb on chips and a meatlovers pizza. The food was very good quality and tasted delicious. The pizza's are woodfired and it was perfectly done. The lamb on chips\/lamb snack pack was also very tasty and filling. Thank you very much! Darlo This place is great. I got stuck in Auckland for a couple of weeks and was staying nearby - this place caught my eye so went in to try. Food was really great, very tasty and a great price. I enjoyed it so much i went back again a few nights later! Would recommend all to try it. Andrew This place has become my goto Turkish eatery. In my opinion the best lamb in Auckland and the rice is cooked so perfectly fluffy. The eatery is open late and I like to bring my friends here. The team is also very friendly. Dan Absolutely beautiful meals. We had the Lamb Shish Kebab and Mixed Platter . The lamb was perfect and so delicious. Both meals flavorsome and extremely enjoyable. We both so enjoyed our meals and our time at the little Turkish café. We will be making this a regular place to eat. The service was friendly, welcoming, flawless.3 Lynette Stumbled across this awesome little cafe in Auckland during my weekend stay. We ordered the lamb on chips and a meatlovers pizza.

However, we understand that dietary preferences and requirements vary, so we still offer a non-animal fat fryer option for vegetarians and those with dietary needs, or simply for those who prefer a different taste! FOOD Drinks welcome to a special piece of New Zealand history... This classic steam tug was one of the last of her kind. Originally named the Aucklander , she was delivered from Scotland all the way to Auckland in 1958. She spent years towing and ship handling around the Auckland port until she was replaced by the technology of new engines. In 1986, a Wellington businessman by the name of Clem Griffiths purchased her to establish Wellington’s first and only floating restaurant. After renaming the vessel Tapuhi II , the “Tugboat on the Bay” restaurant opened to the public at Oriental Bay in 1992. She’s undergone quite a few changes over the years, but to this day she continues to float proudly. Now under new management, we hope to provide you with friendly service, delicious food and the best views of the harbour! Come eat, drink and relax – you’re always welcome on our boat. Looking for a venue? We have the perfect spot to host your next party or event. Email us theboatnz@gmail.com today to discuss your options!

John Barker Escape Huka Lodge has legendary status in New Zealand, it is spoken about in revered tones. On arrival, I realised there may be more to this place than a fancy room and breath-taking views. Kelli Brett Cuisine I cannot readily articulate just how the property held me in its grasp at first sight. However, it did, and still does to this day. Was it the sheer force and power of the turquoise green waters of the Waikato River on the one hand and all that tranquility and softness on the other? Perhaps it was simply the contradiction of the two. Alex van Heeren Founder, Huka Lodge There are so many things to like: the riverfront setting; the lavish duplex accommodations; and the superb cuisine.

Along the track you will see a number of native re-vegetation plantings. Turn left onto the northern Inland Track and do the loop walk back to Mackays Crossing via Whareroa Road. Te Ara o Tipapa (wetland walk) 45 minutes return \/ easy This track runs through the Mackays Crossing wetlands, then crosses low dunes to wetlands that alternate seasonally from dry to wet. Continue to the bush remnant, the only piece of original kahikatea forest remaining on the Kāpiti Coast. You can follow a shady track through the remnant or walk on by for good views over the equestrian paddock and the park entrance. Further on you walk through the “Marines” wetland, first planted in 2003, then past the memorial commemorating the camps that were here during World War II. Coastal Track 1 hour 20 minutes \/ moderate This walk follows the seaward dunes along the coast between Paekākāriki and Whareroa Beach, with an entry point at either end. See pingao and spinifex catching and holding the sand on the foreshore while further back muehlenbeckia, shore bindweed and flax protect and strengthen the dune system. A variety of short tracks along the way link with the beach. This is an intermediate mountain bike track with some short, steep sections. If you wish to continue north to Raumati South, you can either use the beach or the Te Ara o Whareroa trail. Find out more at Find Your Wild Inland Track 40 minutes \/ moderate Th e main section of the Inland Track winds through rolling sand dune ridges between the Memorial lookout in Paekākāriki and heads north providing stunning views of both Mana and Kāpiti Island.

Retrace the steps of the US Marines who used this track to walk between Camp Mackay and Paekākāriki in 1942 and 1943. A sheltered, undulating track that is an easy to intermediate mountain bike ride. Te Ara o Whareroa 2 hours \/ easy to moderate This is an easy 6km sealed trail that traverses the dune lands of Kāpiti Coast, just one hour’s drive from Wellington. The trail extends from Poplar Avenue in Raumati South all the way through Queen Elizabeth Park to Tilley Road in Paekākāriki. This popular shared route is used by locals for recreational walking and biking. Find out more at Find Your Wild Dune Swamp Loop 30 minutes\/easy to moderate This area has been a long term restoration project by The Friends of QEP and Greater Wellington. Initially the area was planted with pioneer species and now trees such as kahikatea are starting to emerge. The planting has gradually crept year-by[1]year towards the railway line and is slowly helping to form a bush corridor from the coast to Whareroa Farm, and eventually Akatarawa Forest. The walk is a reasonably flat grass track that can be a little bit muddy in the winter. It’s suitable for most fitness levels, walking and horse riding, but not ideal for buggies. Peatland Ridge Track 30 minutes\/easy to moderate The 1.4km walk from Rainbow Court to the Pony Club gate follows gentle undulating terrain that allows you to see the transition from farming to a newly formed native forest. You will walk past regenerating native bush and newly formed natural wetlands as you get near the Old Farm Track. Continue onto the ridge where you will have views over the northern corner of the park where much of the area has being replanted. This replanting was an initiative funded by The Maclean Trust. A peat restoration project is also in the pipeline. Old Farm Track 60 minutes\/easy This 3.5km flat, easy walk will take you through previously farmed areas of the park. You will see native regeneration take place over the coming years which is the result of the Recloaking Papatūānuku project started in 2022. Walk from Poplar Avenue in Raumati South (this entrance is not suitable for parking) all the way to the Mackays Crossing entrance. Peatland Loop 40 minutes\/moderate This 2.2km loop is a great place to bring your horse as it's a more remote grass track and not as suitable for cycling. You may see a number of changes in this area over the coming years due to peat restoration projects. Kānuka Track 7 mins\/easy This 500m track links from Te Ara o Whareroa Trail into the parts of the park opened in 2022 and conveniently connects with The Old Farm Track and The Peatland Loop. See more Walking and tramping add Mountain biking and cycling The Te Ara o Whareroa trail runs from one end of the park to the other, connecting Paekākāriki with Raumati South. It's the perfect place for a family bike ride as the track is sealed, making it accessible for all kinds of wheels, and easier for little legs. There are a number of other tracks available to cyclists. While these are not sealed, they aren't necessarily designed for die-hard mountain bikers, and instead would be suited to recreational riders, families and those wanting to take it easy and admire the view. Before you go All tracks are shared with pedestrians and some tracks are also shared with horses, so take care and give way to other users. If you're interested in more challenging routes, across the motorway at Whareroa Farm , you can find a number of tracks that will provide more interesting terrain.

There is also plenty of space to park horse floats. Things to think about Follow the parks care code Model aircraft and trams in the park - both can be scary for horses. The jumps at the front of the park are for organised activities only. See the Eventing Wellington website for details. Beach and tracks Horse riding is allowed on multiple tracks in the park. You can also ride in the neighbouring Whareroa Farm where there is a good range of riding tracks. Horses are permitted on all Kāpiti beaches with restrictions on beach urban areas during summer . You must ride your horse in a safe and careful manner when on the beach. Keep your horse out of the dunes, as these areas are fragile and contain breeding birds and erosion-control plants.

Volunteering in our parks See more Volunteering add History Queen Elizabeth Park and the land it sits on has long attracted people to the area. Māori and European settlement history Māori have been living here for hundreds of years and there were major settlements at Wainui and Whareroa up until the mid-1800s. At the beginning of the 19th century, the Kāpiti Coast was occupied by the Muaupoko and Ngati Apa peoples. Over the 19th century there were a number of raids and resulting battles that brought other tribes to the area, including Ngapuhi, Ngati Toa, Ngati Whatua, Waikato and Maniopoto. The land where Queen Elizabeth Park now sits was an important area. The waterways between the sand hills were deep and plentiful, and it was said that canoes could be paddled from Paekākāriki to Waikanae. From the 1830s onwards, European ships, including whaling boats regularly moored in between Kāpiti Island and the coast, as it was a sheltered place to settle. Local Māori gradually left the area and European settlers farmed there. Land was cleared, the wetlands between the sand hills drained and pasture sown. From the 1840s the beach formed part of the main road north, with many travellers stopping overnight at Whareroa. Communication routes improved further and the railway line between Wellington and Foxton was completed in 1886. By the turn of the 20th century, the beach highway was still providing access for the beachfront sections being developed in Raumati and Paraparaumu. The history of this area is rich and complex. For more detailed information, see the QEP Resource Statement (PDF 2.8 MB) . See more Historic add US Marines history Between 1942 and 1944 you would have been forgiven for thinking Queen Elizabeth Park had been taken over by Americans, because we had! During those years over 15,000 American troops were stationed at Queen Elizabeth Park (then Camp Russell), Whareroa Farm (then Camp Mackay) and Paekākāriki Village (then Camp Paekākāriki). When World War II broke out in 1939, New Zealand gave total support to Britain and sent our army to the Mediterranean. By 1942, Singapore had fallen and the South Pacific was under threat by Japan. New Zealand agreed to leave its army in North Africa, and so the United States Marines were sent to New Zealand to prepare for the possibility of a Pacific War and protect the country from an invasion. Training tragedy Training took up a lot of the troops' time. The land around the camps was used for live firing exercises, and there were 24km route marches up Paekākāriki Hill Road (known as \"Little Burma Road\" to the marines), as well as exercises on the Tararua Ranges. One training activity ended in the deaths of 10 sailors. On June 20, 1943 there was a beach landing training. They were practising for assaults on the Japanese occupied Pacific Islands. Everything seemed to go wrong during this exercise. One boat, named the \"beach party\" was supposed to be the first onshore and the last to leave the shore during the exercise. Their job was to prepare the beach for the 1,600 marines to follow them. This boat had 25 men on board. During the exercise the tide stranded the boats on the beach, while the weather hit them with freezing cold rain and strong winds and a rising surf. As the last boat off the beach, the beach party didn't leave the shores until after nightfall. When they finally did get to the water their engine woudn't start so a larger boat towed them out stern first (backwards). The waves crashed onto the boat and because the boat was backwards it couldn't ride the waves, instead they hit it and went over it with force. When they were still a good distance from the ship, the boat capsized, throwing the 25 men into the freezing sea. Ten men drowned that night, nine swam ashore and six more were picked up by rescue boats. The WWII U.S. Marines Camp interpretation tells the story of the Marines based at the camp and local residents. We would like to acknowledge The Kapiti US Marines Trust for the work they have done bringing this project to life. You can find this sign via the Wellington Road, Paekākāriki Entrance to Queen Elizabeth Park, near where Wainui Stream crosses Queen Elizabeth Road. Find the location on Google Maps.
