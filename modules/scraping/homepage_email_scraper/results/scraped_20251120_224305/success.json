This is absolutely not the level of safety, quality, or care that we strive to provide to our guests. Please be assured that this matter has been taken very seriously. Our Food & Beverage and Culinary teams have conducted a full investigation and implemented additional quality control checks to ensure this does not happen again. We appreciate that our manager was able to speak with you at the time, and we regret that your stay was impacted so negatively. We also apologise for the separate experience at breakfast and the delay in service. Your comments have been shared directly with our restaurant management team, and retraining is already underway to improve both food preparation and service consistency. Your feedback is invaluable in helping us improve, and we deeply regret that your stay did not reflect the high standards we aim to uphold. We sincerely hope you might reconsider in the future and allow us the opportunity to restore your confidence in Accor and our Darwin Airport properties. Warm regards, The Team at Novotel, Mercure & Ibis Darwin Airport Customer review rating 1.0\/5 Helen C. Families - 11\/11\/2025 Confirmed reviews ALL Booked a staycation with family to celebrate a birthday and wish we’d have stayed elsewhere. Pool was great but there was so service available around the pool or even through the cabana that we booked despite QR codes on every single table saying we could order and collect. Room was OK, bathroom smelt of sewerage throughout the entire stay but aircon was cold, probably the one good thing about the room. We decided to try the pool side restaurant for dinner and after picking a table we were asked to move as it was “booked”, moved to a table under the window and froze under the aircon before realising the table next to where we originally wanted to sit was now free so we asked to move. Staff did not clean the table and we had to ask for new glasses and cutlery. Drinks took 30mins to arrive and appetisers arrived first. We ordered the ceviche and it was rotten, the fish itself smelt so bad and was gray. We alerted staff immediately and were lectured on 2 separate occasions by 2 different staff members about ceviche being raw fish… (we often enjoy ceviche regularly as we fish a lot and prepare it ourselves) very patronising and we decided to cancel the rest of the food and catch a cab into town. Upon returning to the hotel at 10.30pm the staff were unwelcoming and as a female, I felt intimated by the night staff around the hotel. Safe to say we won’t be back to stay… See more See more about the review from Helen C. Our hotel has responded to the review Our hotel has responded to the review from Helen C. Dear Helen, Thank you for taking the time to share such detailed feedback about your recent stay. We are very sorry to hear that your experience did not meet expectations, particularly on what should have been a special and relaxing family celebration. Please accept our sincerest apologies for the issues you encountered — from the service delays and maintenance concerns in your room, to the disappointing experience in the restaurant. The quality of food you described and the way your concern was handled are unacceptable and well below our standards. We have shared your comments directly with our Food & Beverage and Culinary teams for urgent review and retraining. We are also sorry that you felt uncomfortable upon returning later in the evening. The safety and comfort of our guests are our highest priorities, and we will be following up with our night team to ensure our service remains professional and welcoming at all times. We truly appreciate you highlighting both the positives, such as our pool and air conditioning, and the areas where we must do better. Your feedback helps us make meaningful improvements to the overall guest experience. Thank you again for bringing this to our attention, and please know that your comments are being taken seriously. We hope you might consider giving us another opportunity in the future to provide the quality stay and service you rightfully expected. Warm regards, The Team at Novotel, Mercure & Ibis Darwin Airport Customer review rating 5.0\/5 William K. Solo - 11\/10\/2025 Confirmed reviews ALL Overnighted while waiting for connecting flight.

    "homepage_content":"Home | Collins Court Butchers | Mount Gambier | SA ABOUT US Mick Lamond has been working in the meat industry for almost two decades and in July 2006 branched out on his own and set up Collins Court Butchers. Back then, it was a two person operation but from little things, big things grew, and after setting up a loyal customer base and securing wholesale contracts to the region’s pubs and sporting clubs, all within two years, Collins Court Butchers started to expand. Today Mick employs six staff and the business shows no signs of slowing. Priding themselves on sourcing locally produced beef, lamb and pork, Collins Court Butchers has the runs on the board in terms of industry accolades as well. In 2017 they took out the Australian Meat Industry Council’s Sausage King Competition for best pork sausage in South Australia, finishing second nationwide, with their beef & chicken sausages finishing second in the South Australian event. Customer service and using locally sourced product are the other cornerstones to the Collins Court Butcher business. “Customer service is the most important thing,” Mick said. “We are always trying to help our customers and we will source anything for them or do anything for them that we can. We also want to support local and use local wherever we can.” PRODUCTS BEEF CHICKEN LAMB PORK SPECIALTIES - Lamb Yiros Parcels - Chicken Sundried & Fetta Parcel - Stuffed Mushrooms - Sausage Rolls - Family Meat Pies - Gluten & Preservative Free Sausages - Cryvacing Of Meat for Camping Value Pack $150 1 x Chicken Twin Pack 1 Kg Grilling Steak 1 Kg Rissoles 1 Kg Mince 1 Kg Sausages 1 Kg Lamb Chops 1 Kg Beef Schnitzel C.C.B Pack $120 1 x Chicken Twin Pack 1 Kg Stir-Fry 1 Kg Lamb Chops 1 Kg Mince 1 Kg Sausages 1 Kg Marinated Chicken Wings BBQ Pack For 4 $60 1\/2 Kg BBQ Steak 1\/2 Kg BBQ Sausages 1\/2 Kg Chicken Steaks 6 x Rissoles 4 x Kebabs BBQ Pack for 8 $120 1 Kg BBQ Steak 1 Kg BBQ Sausages 1 Kg Chicken Steaks 12 x Rissoles 8 x Kebabs Family Pack $100 1 Kg Stir-Fry 1 Kg Sausages 1 Kg Schnitzel 1 Kg Chicken Wings 1 Kg Mince Couples Pack $40 1\/2 Kg Mince 1\/2 Kg Sausages 1 x Double Breast Chicken Fillet 2 x Lamb Forequarter Chops 1\/2 Kg Bacon FOR HIRE Gas hooded spit $120\/day incl gas bottle *conditions apply Can arrange drop off and pick up Cool Room 10 x 6ft $150\/day *conditions apply Can arrange drop off and pick up 174 Jubilee Hwy, Mount Gambier SA 5290 (08) 8725 7060 collinscourtbutcher@bigpond.com www.collinscourtbutcher.com.au",

Support your locals, keep them going during this current crisis! Kimmy Button I’ve been going here since I was little, 10+ years and it’s always been a joy. Today though, was beyond amazing. Whilst we were eating, and I was breastfeeding when a very nice lady who worked here (I didn’t grab her name) decided to bring me out a large cup of iced water because she remembered how thirsty she got whilst breastfeeding. That small bit of support and acceptance goes such a long way, I can’t thank you enough. Adele Button Love this place Staff are always friendly and a huge range of food and drinks on offer! Carris Button I had an orange and poppyseed muffin that was to die for. Staff were all so friendly and helpful and they have The Big Rolling Pin on their roof for you Australian Big Thing collectors. My pie wasn’t to my taste, it was more of a mince style filling than the cubed meat but still had plenty of flavour. Deanna Button These guys make the best slices in town. So reasonably priced and delish. Hard to not buy a treat or 2 while in there. Service is always outstanding. Great work guys xx Domonique Button Why has nobody mentioned the rolling pin? It's the biggest one in the world. They say you can actually see it from space. Henri's also does great pies. As a self-proclaimed pie aficionado, I am yet to have a better pie on the border. Andy Button Very nice and helpful staff, they made me feel like family. Wickedest Z. Button Henri's Wodonga Bakery is fabulous. It has a fresh juice bar, sells all sorts of meat pies and sausage rolls, plus sandwiches of all kinds. Their pastries are great, and they sell a pink icing vanilla slice. I was recently driving through at lunch time and bought a potato pie with tomato sauce. It had a wonderful flavour. Not too salty, not too hot, the meat and gravy mixed nicely with the potato mash on the top which was sprinkled with bacon bits. Gary Button Wonderful place. The food is always fantastic and the staff awesome. Always love going there after work for a quick coffee and cake while having down time. Highly recommended. Zoe Button Had a great curry pie and an awesome freshly squeezed juice. Mark Button Food is always amazing, and they have friendly staff. Always busy in the place but staff try their hardest to get through as many people as fast as they can. Best pumpkin bread you'll ever eat, if you've never tried it you absolutely have to!! Love their juice and smoothie range and the coffees are always nice and the donuts are amazing!! Best bakery on the border!! Myranda Button Best iced donuts and lovely, friendly service! Rhonda Button Really good variety of all the things you would expect at a traditional bakery. Cake selection is really good, and their bread roll selection is very good. Pies and sausage rolls etc pretty good. Often gets busy and service is efficient and good. I would give it a 5 if the dining inside was modernised and felt a little nicer to eat in.

Have been past it countless times and now that we're living near by, decided to try it. Had the Wolferdown (a meat lovers) and a vegetarian (The Snow Meat). Both were very good.

Reddy roast versus spit roast Some people might search for a spit roast when planning a meal or event, but the truth is that a spit roast often takes hours, requires special equipment, and doesn’t always deliver the consistency you want. That’s where Reddy Roasts makes all the difference. Our ready-to-serve roasts give you the same hearty flavour without the hassle, the wait, or the uneven cooking that spit roasts can bring.

The Dreaming describes the journey of a group of women of all ages who travelled east gathering food, collecting Ngalyipi (Tinospora smilacina or snake vine) and performing ceremonies as they travelled. The women began their journey at Mina Mina where Karlangu (digging sticks) emerged from the ground. Taking these implements the women travelled east creating Janyinki and other sites. Their journey took them eventually beyond Warlpiri country. In contemporary Warlpiri paintings traditional iconography is used to represent the Jukurrpa, associated sites and other elements. The primary motif used in paintings of the Jukurrpa are the Karlangu digging sticks which rose up out of the ground at Mina Mina. The women used them to collect bush tucker on their travels. This painting shows the motion of the digging sticks as the women move them to dig. \"Close (esc)\" Julie Woods Two Sisters Xmas Ball Regular price $14.00 10 in stock 7.6cm \"Close (esc)\" BUSH FOOD PAINTINGS, WEAVING & CARVING BEAUTY & BUSH MEDICINE \"Close (esc)\"",

September 12, 2023 Tourism Chillout Travel Winery Tours Embarking on a wine tour of the Yarra Valley promises a delightful journey through lush vineyards, picturesque landscapes, and an abundance of delectable wines. Whether you’re a wine connoisseur or a casual enthusiast, the Yarra Valley offers an unforgettable experience that blends the elegance of wine tasting with the beauty of nature. While planning your visit, it’s crucial to consider the perfect outfit that seamlessly combines comfort, style, and practicality for a day filled with wine, food, and scenic beauty. The Yarra Valley Wine Tour Experience Before diving into the details of what to wear on your Yarra Valley wine tour, let’s take a moment to appreciate what makes this experience so special. Nestled in the heart of Victoria, Australia, the Yarra Valley boasts a unique terroir that produces exceptional cool-climate wines. Rolling hills covered in vineyards stretch as far as the eye can see, creating a mesmerizing backdrop for your wine adventure. During your wine tour of the Yarra Valley, you’ll have the opportunity to visit world-renowned wineries, taste a variety of exquisite wines, savor gourmet cuisine, and enjoy the region’s serene beauty. The tour typically involves a combination of wine tastings, vineyard tours, and indulgent meals, making it essential to choose an outfit that can effortlessly transition between these activities. The Perfect Yarra Valley Wine Tour Outfit Now, let’s delve into the details of what you should wear to make the most of your Yarra Valley wine tour. Comfortable Footwear Walking through vineyards and winery tours are integral parts of the Yarra Valley wine tour experience. To ensure comfort throughout the day, opt for comfortable and supportive footwear. Closed-toe shoes, such as stylish sneakers or comfortable loafers, are ideal for navigating uneven terrain and ensuring you’re ready for any spontaneous vineyard exploration. Weather-Appropriate Attire The Yarra Valley’s weather can be quite variable, so it’s essential to check the forecast before your visit. During the warm months, lightweight, breathable clothing like sundresses, shorts, and short-sleeve shirts are perfect. In cooler weather, layering is your best friend. Consider wearing a light sweater or cardigan over a blouse or shirt, along with comfortable jeans or trousers. Sun Protection The Yarra Valley’s sunny climate can be both a blessing and a potential source of discomfort. Be sure to pack sunglasses, a wide-brimmed hat or cap, and sunscreen with a high SPF rating to protect your skin from the sun’s rays during outdoor tastings and vineyard tours. Wine Tour Accessories To enhance your wine tour experience, bring along a few essential accessories. A lightweight scarf can add a touch of style and keep you warm if the weather changes unexpectedly. A crossbody bag or a small backpack is perfect for carrying essentials like your wallet, phone, and a water bottle. Layers for Winery Interiors Many Yarra Valley wineries have cozy and temperature-controlled interiors where you can enjoy tastings. It’s a good idea to have a layering option, like a stylish blazer or a shawl, to stay comfortable indoors without feeling too warm. Dress to Impress While comfort is key, it’s also essential to maintain a sense of style on your Yarra Valley wine tour. Dressing well shows respect for the wineries and their craft. A smart-casual outfit, such as a flowy sundress for women or slacks and a button-down shirt for men, strikes the perfect balance between comfort and sophistication. Light Outerwear Even during the warmer months, evenings in the Yarra Valley can get chilly. Consider bringing a light jacket or a stylish cardigan that compliments your outfit to stay warm during evening events or outdoor dinners. Essential Wine Tour Accessories Don’t forget to accessorize your outfit with a few wine-themed items. A wine tour of the Yarra Valley wouldn’t be complete without a wine glass necklace holder, allowing you to keep your hands free while sipping and exploring. Additionally, a wine journal or tasting notebook can help you remember your favorite wines and the wineries you visited. Conclusion As you embark on your wine tour of the Yarra Valley, remember that your choice of attire can greatly enhance your overall experience. Comfort, style, and practicality should be at the forefront of your outfit decisions. With the picturesque vineyards, world-class wineries, and delectable wines awaiting you, your well-chosen attire will ensure that your Yarra Valley wine tour is nothing short of extraordinary. So, pack your bags, put on your best wine-tour-appropriate outfit, and get ready to savor the flavors of the Yarra Valley while enjoying the perfect blend of nature, culture, and wine. … How to Manage Your Airbnb Property Portfolio Remotely September 25, 2022 Tourism Managing your Airbnb property portfolio remotely is a great way to free up time and save money. You can still be hands-on with your Airbnb property and make sure everything is running smoothly from anywhere in the world. Here are some tips on how to manage your Airbnb property portfolio remotely: Use a Calendar for Booking and Cleaning You don’t have to check in with guests every day (in fact, it might be best not to). But you do need to make sure that they have everything they need during their stay and that nothing goes wrong. Use a calendar app like Google Calendar or iCal so you can see who checked in and when and when they will be checking out. This way, if anything needs fixing, you can get in touch with the guest before they leave so they aren’t inconvenienced by having to call you at home or during work hours after arriving at their destination. Use a Virtual Assistant The best way to make sure that your property is being maintained and managed properly is by hiring a virtual assistant (VA). VAs can help with the day-to-day tasks that you don’t want to deal with yourself, like dealing with guests, cleaning up after them, and even interacting with other VAs who work on behalf of other hosts. Some VAs specializes in being “Airbnb concierges” — they’ll handle all aspects of guest communication and make sure everything goes smoothly during their stay. Be Sure to Set Up Email Alerts for Any Important Events As an owner, you’ll want to be notified when something significant happens on your property(ies). Examples include: A guest has booked a reservation. You can set up an alert that will notify you when a new booking is made. This is especially useful if your calendar is shared with other people who need access to it (e.g., a property manager). Make Sure You Have Adequate Coverage for Your Insurance Policies Before Taking on Additional Properties In order to avoid costly mistakes, be sure that you have adequate coverage before taking on too many properties or additional responsibilities with your current properties. Use the Airbnb App as Much as Possible This includes everything from checking reservation statuses via mobile app (which lets you see how many nights each booking lasts) to communicating with guests via chat or phone calls (so long as they have provided their contact details). The more you use the app, the less time you’ll have to spend futzing with spreadsheets and other apps. Use Automated Payments Automate your rent collection with a platform like RentMoola or SquareSpace. This will make it easier to keep track of all your expenses in one place, and you won’t have to worry about forgetting to send the rent check each month. Keep Track of All Your Expenses in One Place Use accounting software such as Quickbooks or Freshbooks to manage finances and create invoices for tenants. You can also use these platforms to send out reminders if they haven’t paid their rent on time. Plan ahead for Vacancies If you don’t want any vacancies in your property portfolio, then plan ahead and make sure that there are always enough people interested in renting from you at any given time. You can do this by listing multiple units at once on Airbnb, increasing your chances of filling them all up again before they go vacant. This way, you don’t have long periods of time when no money is coming in from those properties! Use Holiday House Management Services If you’re traveling during peak vacation times like Christmas or New Year’s Eve, consider hiring a professional holiday house manager to oversee your property during that time period. This person will take care of all maintenance issues before guests arrive and handle any problems that arise while they’re there — all while ensuring that the home looks great when they leave so they can get their deposit back quickly after their stay ends. There are many holiday house management services online but it is a must to get the accredited one. Managing an Airbnb portfolio remotely can seem like quite a daunting task. However, it can be done, and in the best way possible. By carefully organizing your properties and learning how to maximize automation, you can rest assured that your strategies will be optimized and your vacation rental business will run as smoothly as possible. … How to Save Money on Business Admin Tasks August 24, 2022 Uncategorized Outsourcing business processes doesn’t mean sending jobs away overseas. It means using high-value information technologies to efficiently handle repetitive or complex tasks, freeing resources for other strategic projects. What’s the difference? For example, sometimes it is more practical to send a workforce job overseas as opposed to outsourcing. Think of your business as a department store. If you had people that worked in the basement putting boxes together and then handing them off to another group on another floor and they hand it off again to someone on another floor and so on until the very top where they put it into shipping containers and send those off to be shipped out — that’s outsourcing but you have created your own physical infrastructure in-house that is working out of a central location (your downtown) as opposed to having everyone go out into different locations around town (outsourcers). Ways To Save Money on Business Admin Tasks Outsourcing business processes is the ability of a business to transfer key activities to dedicated specialists, who can perform those processes more effectively than the company could manage itself. This is done in the hope that this will allow the company to increase its performance and gain a competitive advantage. There are many benefits to outsourcing business processes. Improvements in Productivity By outsourcing a company’s call center, you can free up your employees to do more productive work. With an outsourced call center, staff members don’t have to answer the same questions over and over again when they already have answers readily available. Employees will be able to focus on other pressing issues that require their attention. Increased Customer Satisfaction One of the biggest advantages of outsourcing is that it enables companies to increase customer satisfaction levels by providing higher quality service than they could provide internally. Customers can contact a live person who speaks their language and understands their needs, which makes for happier customers and greater brand loyalty for your organization’s products or services Shorter Implementation Timeframes Outsourcing allows companies to quickly scale up from start-up mode into high-growth mode without having to recruit new employees or invest in training programs for internal staff members who need specialized skillsets that aren’t easily found in today’s marketplace. Cost Effective Outsourcing business processes is a cost-effective way to manage your business. By outsourcing, your company can focus on its core competencies and let a third party handle the rest. With the right service provider, you’ll get more for less — meaning that you’ll spend less time and money on things like payroll, accounting, and benefits administration. Increased Flexibility Companies that outsource their business processes have more flexibility than those that don’t. For example, if your firm needs to hire an extra employee or two in order to meet a deadline or complete an important project, you can easily do so without having to consider how much it will cost or how long it will take to train them up on what they need to know in order to get started on the job right away. Better Customer Service Companies that outsource their business processes are able to provide better customer service than those that do not. This is because outsourced companies have teams of experts at their disposal who can be assigned specific tasks and compensated for doing so according to their individual skill sets and experience levels in this particular field of work (such as finance or human resources). Take Aways Outsourcing allows you to focus on the core of your business, by providing a competent team that handles your business processes for you. This not only allows for faster solutions but cheaper solutions as well. Moreover, a reliable outsourcing services provider is a trend that is here to stay. As businesses across the world continually look for ways to streamline their operations, more and more companies are either turning to offshore outsourcing or implementing automation with varying degrees of success…. How to prepare & recover – Giro style November 11, 2020 Tourism The Giro d’Italia is easily one of the world’s most stunning, albeit challenging, cycles. From the towering Alps to the formidable Dolomites and the Apennines’ pristine beauty, the Giro is a passionate cyclist’s rite of passage. Any experienced cyclist will therefore know that this is not a ride to be taken lightly – you have to prepare yourself for its gruelling ascents, some of which last for over 20kms. Not only that, when taking part in the tour you have to ensure that your body recovers in time for the next stage. Fancy riding the exact track that’s ridden during the Giro? Our partners at A’qto run cycling holidays of the Giro d’Italia that are sure to get your blood pumping. Here are some tips for preparing and recovering like a Giro pro. Take care of your gut health Poor gut health and digestive problems often cause cyclists great trouble when traversing long passages. To prepare your gut and digestive system for your tour it is best to get started pre-tour. Cut out any foods that can irritate your stomach including acidic foods. Furthermore, reduce your intake of caffeine and alcohol whilst increasing your vegetable intake. Train regularly This cannot be stressed enough. You want to be match fit when you arrive at the Giro as it truly is a competitor’s circuit. Ensure that whenever you have the opportunity to cycle at home – you do it. Take your training to the nearest location that is roughly similar to the Giro’s landscapes and ascents. Doing this will train your cardio and muscles to be prepared for those more challenging stages. Study up The Giro is well worth studying before undertaking. It is replete with stunning mountain passes and hairpin turns in abundance, something which can be quite challenging for those who didn’t take the time to properly estimate the ride’s significance. Study up before taking on the tour so that you know exactly what your body has to be prepared for as well as how to organise your training sessions. Eat after training Eating after any form of training is important for refuelling your body and cycling is no exception. It’s imperative to eat at least half an hour after training as this provides your body with the nutrients it needs to properly recover and have your body ready for further training. The same goes for when you are on the tour itself. Eating on the tour It’s vital for any cyclist mid-tour to eat a healthy, nutritious breakfast before starting out. Whilst it may be tempting to launch into the abundance of breads that are an Italian breakfast staple, these often will not provide you with the nutrients you need to effectively take on a stage. Stick to something light and nutritious – fruits are recommended as well as breakfast smoothies to give you a much-needed morning energy boost. Enjoy yourself As an experienced cyclist, you will know that this is going to be one of the most rewarding life experiences you can undertake. And whilst it does take some work and dedication to prepare for, this is all just part of the incredible experience that is the Giro d’Italia. … Where to go Camping in New South Wales? August 26, 2020 Tourism So, you’re planning to visit New South Wales for your next vacation? Well, you must consider bringing your camping equipment with you because NSW is best known for its camping spots. Most of the camping spots are popular worldwide but some camping spots are only popular among locals. So, if you’re willing to enjoy a relaxing experience, you must consult the locals to find the best camping spots. Fortunately, we’ve prepared a list of some amazing spots where you can go camping in New South Wales. So, without wasting any time, let’s talk about what kind of experience you’d get in these spots. Honeymoon Bay, Jervis Bay If you’re willing to enjoy a bush camping experience, it’s the best spot for you. This campsite is located around 3 hours away from Sydney at the northern end of Jervis Bay. You’d get to explore some incredible beaches in this spot. The locals often visit this campsite during school holidays and even on weekends. You need to visit this campsite during the weekdays because this is how you can easily find a spot. There isn’t any gas cooking equipment available at this campsite. So, you must bring your equipment with you. Also, you must bring plenty of drinking water with you. Yuraygir National Park, Wooli Yuraygir National Park has a 65km of coastline where you can find the best beachside campsites. Make sure that you use a high-clearance 4WD for traveling because it gets difficult to go past the Pebbly Beach campground. That’s why these campsites aren’t mostly crowded by people. So, you can enjoy a comfortable and relaxing experience. You won’t even have to book a site before going there. Simply, bring your stuff with you and enjoy an incredible camping experience. Mimosa Rocks National Park It’s the best camping spot for those who like to travel in a caravan. You’d get to see some beautiful trees, rocks, and beaches in this tourist spot. You can go for a picnic or enjoy the coastal walks in this park. The reason why it’s an ideal spot for caravan travelers is that there isn’t any drinking water here. And you’re also supposed to bring the cooking equipment with you. And that can only happen if you have a bigger vehicle to store the equipment. You don’t need to bring an expensive caravan to have some fun in this picnic spot. A Retreat caravan would be enough for bringing the required equipment. If you don’t already have one, you can easily find Retreat Caravans for Sale from our friends at Freestyle RVs. So, load everything into the caravan and get ready to enjoy an incredible vacation….

Leave Us Your Thoughts. I booked out the restaurant for my mother’s 70th birthday. The staff were very accommodating, and there was plenty of food for everyone at a great price. Daniel Hazelton Delicious end-of-the-week meal! I had the sizzling seafood, which was perfect, and my wife’s Cashew Duck was pretty good too. It was really busy, but once we were seated, the meals came out in a flash. If only Dapto had nicer streetscapes! Definitely going back. Ken Davis Fantastic local restaurant. We had ordered home delivery through Menulog and the driver never arrived to pick it up. The team then offered to deliver it just before closing time at no charge… There isn’t anywhere else I can think of that would do that for you. Food was still delicious despite the wait which was out of their control. We really appreciated the delivery and the A1 customer service from the team. Local legends falls short in reviewing their efforts tonight! Ash Mansell We had number 54 Beef Stirfry Cashew nut, 57 Pad Kee Mao and Thai Chicken Rice.

There’s always something happening; how much you choose to do is up to you, take life by the reins and explore all this hidden gem has to offer, or sit back and just go with the flow. Bingara, known as the “Gem on the Gwydir”, is a great place to visit and an even better place to live. Safe and friendly, Bingara has clean air, clear skies and a great climate. Surrounded by rolling hills, the town rests in a natural amphitheatre. The spectacular Gwydir River is the life blood of the town, and its beauty is indeed priceless. History Bingara started life as a river crossing for teamsters travelling north, however it wasn’t until the 1880s when prospectors flocked to the area following the discovery of tin, then diamonds, that the town flourished, and rapid development followed. Bingara became a municipality in 1890 and at its peak, the main street alone boasted five general stores, six hotels, and all the services required to maintain a largely self-sufficient town. World economic recession and the end of mining saw the town contract, leaving a heritage of beautiful commercial and public architecture, and the now fully restored Roxy Theatre. Top things to do Bingara may be a small town by city standards, but there is no shortage of things to see and do, and it need not cost any money. 1. Fossicking The Bingara district is a fossickers paradise. Whichever road you take out of town you will find a spot to fossick for gold, gems and crystals. It was the discovery of gold in 1852 that brought a flow of prospectors to the district and it continues to this day. 2. ENTERTAINMENT Living in a country town does not mean that you have to live in a cultural void. On the contrary, residents of the Bingara district are privileged to have the arts firmly embroiled in their everyday lives. Art shows, cultural events and live theatre are the norm for the children of Bingara. 3. BUSH ACTIVITIES The picturesque river and mountains surrounding Bingara make it the ideal destination to discover the magic of the bush. You see it, you touch it, you live it. Whether you discover it by car or on foot all you need to do is look around and up, to experience the same as our ancestors. 4. Recreation There is no excuse for inactivity in Bingara, because the town has something for everyone. Whether you like to take a leisurely stroll or bike ride along the banks of the Gwydir River, throw in a fishing line, take a dip in the local swimming pool or prefer a more arduous climb up to Batterham Lookout, the choice is yours. 5. EXPLORING Using Bingara as a base, there are many delightful half and full-day drives which will take you into the hills, valleys and beyond. Whether your interest lies in geographical wonders unique to this area, or historical steps back in time, or whether you simply want a relaxing day out, we have it right here on our doorstep.

    "homepage_content":"Daisy's Place is Currently Closed Skip to content Daisy’s Place, located near the Caloundra turnoff on Steve Irwin Way in Glenview, stands as a testament to nearly a century of history. Originally built in 1923 as The Rustic Cabin by Master Builder Jess Samuel D. Johnson and his wife, Daisy Emma Johnson, the tea house quickly became a well-loved stop for weary travellers along what was then the Bruce Highway. Famous for its homemade pies and Devonshire teas, the Rustic Cabin was first located 100 meters north of its current site before being relocated in 1942 under a Queensland Forestry Lease. Tragedy struck the Johnson family when their daughter, Doris, drowned nearby in 1937, followed by Mr. Johnson’s passing in 1948. Despite these hardships, Daisy continued to run the establishment until her death in 1979. In 2010, former Mooloolah resident Sue Joseph, who had once worked at the Rustic Cabin, purchased the property and undertook extensive renovations to restore the termite-damaged structure. By mid-2011, the café was reborn as Daisy’s Place, with Daisy Johnson’s former living quarters transformed into an intimate dining and reading space. Today, Daisy’s Place remains a cherished part of the Sunshine Coast’s history, surrounded by the scenic Jowarra Interpretive Forest Walk, which offers visitors a glimpse into the area’s natural beauty alongside its rich past.

Testimonials â Great Food & Service Came here on a visit from the UK and happened to stumble across this restaurant as it was near our apartment. Food was fantastic, lots of vegetarian options and the service was great. The chef also gave us complimentary chocolate naan which is a must! Charlotte F Tasty Food & Great Service Got there right when it opened at 6. Able to order quickly and food came out promptly. Got a huge meal which we managed to finish because everything was so delicious. Samosas to start: two tasty fried potato dumplings. Then cheese and garlic naan: I had never had this and it was a culinary experience. Unbelievably tasty. Chicken Tikka masala: way above average. Lamb rogan josh: best I have ever had. Chet P Home Away from Home! Visited our first Indian restaurant in Australia and I must say it lived up to the reviews !! The food was lovely, but the stand out factor was the great service from the chef himself. A lovely man with a huge heart, walking round and having conversations with all his guests. Me and my partner thought it reminded us of a curry house local to our home in London. A home away from home! Harry L Top -->",

Wedding Venue Kind Words We recently had the pleasure of having Celebrity chef Shannon Kellam dine with us at The Golden Pig. Read the article below for his full review. As a fervent food lover, dining here was a treat. Each dish presented a symphony of flavors, prepared with precision and presented with artistic flair. But what sets The Golden Pig apart is its fantastic cooking school. I enrolled in one of their weekend classes, and it was enlightening! The chef-instructors possess a wealth of knowledge and are generous in sharing their tips and techniques. It's not just dining; it's an experience, a journey through the art of cooking. Can't wait for my next visit! Google Review It was one of the best dining experiences I've had, not just in Brisbane, but globally! We did the $90pp banquet menu. The food was amazing!!! Every single dish was amazing. We were blown away. The food volume was more than enough! Good wine list with stargazer by the glass. Be sure to book, this place is popular! This is a restaurant I'll return to! Google Review The Golden Pig is a culinary gem! With its warm and inviting ambiance, this restaurant delivers a delightful experience. The menu boasts a creative fusion of Asian flavors, leaving your taste buds utterly satisfied. Impeccable service and a well-curated wine list complete the perfect dining affair. Highly recommended!

Ideal for exploring the area, sightseeing. Comfortable and clean\/well resourced apartment. We had a large private garden area and found self catering an easy option. Staff were incredibly helpful and we were delighted with our choice of accommodation in every way. As this was my first time I absolutely loved everything about this holiday apartment. The aircon, your own veranda, pool and the view from my room was awesome. The owners were very friendly and so for that I hope to go back one day and maybe stay a bit longer. I would absolutely recommend these apartments to all who want to stay there. We had a lovely time here. The owner is super helpful and friendly. The rooms were spotlessly clean. Every room has air conditioning, the rooms are spacious and comfortable and the beds were also very comfortable. The apartment is conveniently located to all the fun things in Cairns. All I can say is WOW! First time traveller, decided to check this place out for their competitive rates and sizable rooms. Both of the hosts were amazing, and made me feel welcome from the moment I arrived. Rooms are more than adequately sized with a nice quiet ambiance. The hosts were also a great help in both advising the best touristic attractions to take, and provided help with booking on certain dates. Don't hesitate to book this place, will not disappoint. What a gem. It's in a quieter part of town and the rooms are really big. Managers are friendly and helpful and the cost made it good value. Pool area was also big with a well equipped bbq that made it a great place to hang out with kids.

I was impressed! The service was great and the room was very clean. Sometime the small things make a big impression, for me it was cold water in the fridge, a biscuit and tea and coffee. After traveling along way after hours and getting in late the bed was also very comfortable. Our stay was very comfortable.

Missy601 June 2020 What a great little bar and restaurant What a great little bar and restaurant? It has a nice feel, I love their MB branded beer and the meals are fantastic. The menu has plenty of variety. I can never go past the pork belly entree and the main meals are delicious with large serves. You can sit at tables or at benches and watch the world go by! Thoroughly recommend it. billg63 March 2020 The BEST bar (and Tapas) in Noosa!!! The tapas style food here is some of the best on the coast! Consistently great, high quality and delicious meals \/ bites to eat, at very reasonable prices. The Beef Tataki is outstanding…and if you’re lucky Tuna tataki or sashimi even better! Great pizzas, and pork belly to die for!

Don't just take our word for it—see what our satisfied customers have to say based on their Google Reviews. Everything was so delicious, Is clear the love and the passion that they put in each dish and also the service, the restaurant was full house and 2 waiter handle it with 5 starts Unfortunately feel overpriced the list of wines, if you research the bottles you can find them in Dan Murphy for $25 , the price is x4 . Julian Varon Five of us came to Paris Go Bistro in Carlton on a Tuesday evening for dinner. The service was quite disappointing, as I saw several eyerolls from one waiter in particular, and they all appeared quite impatient and irritated. We ordered a wide selection of food (pictures attached), including the escargot, lamb, fish, chips, salad etc. I must say the food was very delicious but whether or not it was worth $400 for 5 people is up for debate. Thank you to Paris Go Bistro for a fine dining experience! 3\/5 stars. Emily May Went there with groups of friends to celebrate his birthday.. Satisfied. Vibrant ambience,great services,food was delightful. Gabriel showed up to say happy birthday. It was very nice. Definitely will go back there again. Selina Mavric Food was exceptional. Service was good. Restaurant was full which meant it was really noisy & very hard to hear my dining companions. Why do restaurants insist on having so many hard surfaces? I had the king george whiting dumplings which were melt in the mouth. The veal rack special for my main. Both were excellent. Joanne Hurley Delicious french cuisine, prices are at the higher end. You'll be comfortably spending a little over $120 per person, includes a entrees, main meal and a glass of champagne Lovely place to wine and dine that special person, or celebration; warm ambience. Vegetarian options: Plenty of salads and side dishes to choose from. The beetroot salad was delicious, buttery and warm just like a warm summer afternoon. Parking: Lots of street parking, easy access. Kid-friendliness: Yes, table and seats were comfortable and the ambience was very welcoming for young children. They had enjoyed their time. It didn't take long for the food to come out. Wendy Tang Friendly staff and gorgeous food. I think I’ve found a new favourite restaurant. As photographed, we ordered the Poivron Farcies au Beurre Blank (Roasted Capsicum filled with Mushroom Risotto) and the Mussels for entree which were both delicious. For our mains we ordered the Boeuf Bourguignon (that is to die for!), the Salmon (with Scallops), Salade de Betteraves au Chevre (Beetroot Salad) and Frities (Fries) that was more than enough for two people and without fault, it was all amazing. For desert was the Crème Brûlée which by far has been the best I’ve had in Melbourne (and I’ve been everywhere) with a light a fluffy slice of their Duo de Mousses au Chocolate (white and dark chocolate mousse). V K Gorgeous, busy little restaurant in authentic French style. Right up there for quality, in fact nicer meals than some on the other side of town I've been to. Generous servings, everyone was very happy with their meals. Excellent service. Lauris Jones Another FABULOUS meal tonight at Paris Go. Compliments aux chefs ! Can HIGHLY recommend as it NEVER disappoints. Very authentic menu. Always seems like we are back in France whenever we come here. My wife is French and LOVES this place ! We ordered items from the Menu Du Jour (Specials Board) and they were all SO tasty. Excellent drinks list. Very attentive service from the waiting staff as well. FORMIDABLE !! russell baker Delicious meal. Steak was cooked perfectly rare frites were excellent (not just expensive Maccas). The combination entree of cured trout, pâte and terrine was excellent. I didn’t personally enjoy the duck alsace as much, but my friend loved it. Scallops in the barramundi dish were so so good. Perfectly cooked. Zoe L I have been there twice, it’s very nice experience with my family and my French partner, everyone enjoy their food and very friendly service ! Price is fair! Excellent Jessica leung Paris Go was a wonderful dining experience. The French cuisine & the staff were excellent. The only downside were the loud, rude patrons on the table beside us but it did not dampen our good time here. The Escargot, the mixed oysters, the steak tartare and coq au vin were very good.

This dish shows off Tuna’s jewel-like colour against a background of lush greenery. Of course you can leave the Tuna in the pan for longer if you prefer more of a cooked texture … but you will lose the rich red colour.

READ MORE Crab & Corn Frittata Some people find Italian frittatas or Spanish tortillas easier to make than French-style omelettes because they don’t have to be folded, but are finished under the grill instead. If you find this one’s slow to set in the middle, place it into a 180°C oven to finish cooking. Serve it with a green salad, blob of sour cream and sprinkling of chives if you like.

Functions we have catered for including end of the financial year and Christmas celebrations, bucks and hen's night, school excursion, anniversary, birthday and many special occasions as requested by our customers.

Bruce our chef was amazing, the food was 10\/10 and the whole staff were brilliant. Came for the first time for my birthday and will definitely be coming back for more occasions!

The crust is amazing, and cooked to perfection. Added to the excellent service and great value, we will be returning very soon. We went for dinner for a small family gathering and thoroughly enjoyed the food, the service and the atmosphere. The specials were simply fantastic and the kids cleared their plates but couldn’t finish the mountain of gelato! We’ll be back. The pasta and pizza here are divine – my personal favourites being the cheesy gnocchi and the boscaiola. The price points are perfect, and my interactions with the staff have been warm, polite, and attentive. It’s always clean and inviting here, and I’d come back anytime. the woodpeckers The Woodpeckers, revived in 2014, has been around Subiaco for 20 years. We take pride in serving authentic Italian cuisine and Woodfired Pizzas.",

We had the best coffee and chai I have ever had. The people were friendly and service great. Two days later we had planned on going to Maggie Beer's for breakfast and it was closed so we turned up there and ordered the burgers for brunch at about 12noon. OMG they were to die for and I really struggled to finish mine. I only ordered the small! Lovely fresh produce, smiling friendly faces and beverages prepared with love...what more can you ask for. Joy N, Nelson Bay Really Nice has purchased a Almond Milk Latte & Oat Milk Latte I visited here this morning with my daughter and her baby. (We found via trip advisor)The place had a lovely atmosphere and the hostess was very friendly. I was surprised and pleased they had both oak milk and Almond milk. The service was slower than usual but easily excused once the hostess explained that due to Covid she has to reduce staff and tables. We spied a breakfast coming out to the couple next to us. OMG we should have waited and had breakfast here. Looked amazing. The tea cake was lovely too. Great decor. Also an outside space. We sat on the couch. Very comfortable. Highly recommended.

Mount Fuji Guided Day Tour with Kachikachi Ropeway & Matcha-Making Experience ‌ ‌ Japan is well known for a number of things — sushi, tea ceremonies, kimonos, ninjas, anime, manga, and most importantly, cherry blossoms. The very word Japan conjures images of Mount Fuji surrounded by the pink flowers. The sakura (Japanese for ‘cherry blossom’) symbolizes mortality — the fleeting nature of life; it reminds us of how something so beautiful can also be short. The cherry blossom reminds us to live every day to the fullest. Here are some Japan cherry blossom tours you can take to experience the graceful beauty of nature, while making the most of life. Cherry Blossom in Japan Cherry blossoms are a symbol of high importance in Japan, so much so that the flower is even featured on the 100 yen coin. The flower reaches full bloom in spring, which is when visitors flock to popular spots around the city to view these blossoms from and have a picnic under the blanket of these blushing petals. Spring typically is a bit chilly in Japan, with temperatures reaching an average of 12°C in March and about 17°C in April. However, the mornings and nights are especially chilly, with northern parts of Japan such as Hokkaido being especially cold. Hence, it is advised that when you are packing for your cherry blossom tour in Japan, carry along sweaters as well in case it is cold. When is the Cherry Blossom Season in Japan 2021? Cherry blossom season in Japan typically starts around March and goes on till the end of April. The northern parts of the country, such as Hokkaido, typically experience cherry blossom season much later — around May. In some cases, the season starts in February for slow blooming cherry blossom varieties like the Kawazuzakura (found in the city of Kawazu in Izu Peninsula) and the Atamizakura (found in the city of Atami, in Shizuoka perfecture). During this time, you can take a cherry blossom tour in Japan and check out the numerous cherry blossom festivals across the country that take place specifically around this time. The following is a rough approximation of when cherry blossom season starts across the different cities in Japan: Late February: Kawazu, Atami City Early March: Matsuda Mid-March: Minamiashigara City Late March: Fukuoka, Hiroshima, Matsuyama, Tokyo Early April: Kyoto, Nagoya, Nara, Osaka Mid-April: Fuji, Fukushima, Kanazawa, Sendai Late April: Aomori, Hakodate, Hirosaki Early May: Sapporo Cherry Blossoms in Japan See all photos Japan Cherry Blossom Tour 2021 Locations Atami City : Home to the lovely cherry blossom variety Atamizakura, Atami city is a two-hour drive from Tokyo.

A symbol of transience, it is a reminder of the impermanence of life. To look at the beautiful pink canopy surrounding you may make you feel wistful, but is also an inspiration to enjoy every single minute. The cherry blossoms only appear for about a month, so this time is filled with lots of revelry. Many people get together to indulge in hanami (cherry blossom viewing) with picnics or by attending sakura-themed festivals. A cherry blossom tour in Japan takes you to different places in the country from where you can admire the raw beauty of nature with a beautiful pink hue. To admire these delicate flowers is a peaceful experience in its own right. Types of Cherry Blossom Tours Guided Tours A guided tour involves a professional English-speaking guide who tells you everything there is to know about cherry blossom season and takes you to places to get the best view of it. Transfers are usually covered as part of a guided tour, ensuring a hassle-free visit. Combo Tours A combo cherry blossom tour combines visiting the cherry blossoms along with other landmarks or experiences like Mishima Skywalk, Shiraito Falls, Fujisan Sengen Shrine, and Mount Fuji’s fifth station. Transportation and a guide are usually included for a stress-free visit. Which Cherry Blossom Tour Should You Take? Budget-friendly For those looking for a cherry blossom tour that is easy on the pocket, it is best to pick the non-guided or self-guided tour option. This way, you can pick a transport option that’s inexpensive and plan your trip as per your convenience, and including only the sights that you want to explore. Informative Apart from just admiring the cherry blossoms, if you also want to learn more about the history of the region and the importance and symbolism of cherry blossoms, pick a guided tour. While these are a touch more expensive, it is well worth the money, as it also includes transportation. Explorative If you are interested in what’s beyond the cherry blossoms, take a combo tour. As part of this, you can visit the Mount Fuji World Heritage Center, Shiriato Falls, Lake Ashi, Fujisan Sengen Shrine, Hakone-en, and Komagatake. Transfers, an English-speaking guide, and lunch are usually included. What to See In & Around Shizuoka Perfecture Shizuoka Prefecture is about three hours away from Tokyo, and offers some of the best cherry blossom-viewing opportunities. It is also home to Kawazu, Izu Peninsula, which is known for local cherry blossom species, Kawazukzakura, which typically has a longer life than most of the other species. When you go to see the Kawazuzakura, here are some other things you can do in and around Shizuoka Prefecture.

Visitors are also afforded an amazing view of Mount Fuji in all its glory, especially on a clear day. Shiraito Falls : This plunging waterfall (at a height of 150m) gets its water directly from Mount Fuji, and is often referred to as the most beautiful waterfall in Japan. Located within the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, it is surrounded by verdant trees. Its sheer beauty makes you feel connected to nature. Lake Ashi: Take in the stunning views of Mount Fuji as you take a boat cruise atop the sapphire waters of Lake Ashi. You can also see the striking red torii to the Hakone Shrine. During spring, the area is surrounded by cherry blossoms, creating an incredibly magical experience. Mount Fuji Fifth Station : The fifth (and last) station on the southern slope of Mount Fuji, this is the closest station to the summit.

    "homepage_content":"Daawat Brown Rice | India's Best Quality Brown Basmati Rice Brand Uniquely Milled Through Het To Retain Inherent Goodness Asset 1 The Story of Nutrition About 40 years ago, we developed a unique Hydration Enhancement Technology that would help the unpolished grain of rice to retain its essential nutrients and moisture, once separated from its outer-most non-nutritive layer. It works, try and see for yourself! KNOW MORE Nutrition value Each spoonful of Daawat Brown is rich in vitamins and minerals that bring you closer to your health goals. 0 g Protein 0 Kcal Energy 0 mg Sodium 0 g Sugars 0 mg Calcium 0 g Dietary Fiber KNOW MORE Here's How Daawat Brown Basmati Contributes To Your Health Essential Nutrient Abundance High Fibre Goodness Zero Cholesterol Wellness Every Grain Of Daawat Brown Basmati Is A Promise Of Authenticity Most brown rice grains sold in the market lack the full Bran layer. This helps cook it faster but strips the grain of its essential nutrients. Daawat Brown Basmati undergoes the unique HET process so it retains the grain's full Bran layer, natural taste and goodness. The secret behind India's favourite quick cooking Brown Basmati We developed a unique Hydration Enhancement Technique (HET) that makes Daawat Brown Basmati easier to cook while also retaining its inherent goodness by moisturising its Bran layer. The HET process helps water penetrate the grain easily and cooks it in just 15 minutes. Daawat Brown Rice Shelf Life Advantage – It doesn’t become rancid Most of the commonly available Brown Rice becomes rancid after 3-4 months. The rice oil present in the Bran gets rancid due to activity of an enzyme called Lipase. Due to this fact some Brown rice may get rancid even before it reaches to consumer. When you buy Daawat Brown Rice you get the advantage of it staying fresh for minimum 24 months because we have the special technology to deactivate this Lipase enzyme so that it doesn’t become rancid. At the same time we also ensure that the full bran of the rice remains intact & all the benefits & nutrition’s of Brown Rice is delivered to you so that you can enjoy the taste & softness of Daawat Brown Rice. CHEF’S SPECIAL HEALTHY & DELICIOUS BROWN RICE RECIPES Cook with Daawat rice for easy and healthy brown rice recipes. Learn to cook delicious Indian and continental recipes with our celebrity chef Sanjeev Kapoor. Every grain of Daawat brown rice ensures perfection every time you cook with it.

All stunning. Highly recommend this place if you are in town. Ben Perceval Most amazing Thai we have had since being in Thailand! It was so hard to choose a favourite dish and our kids loved everything as well! Well priced food and wine with great service. Highly recommend, we will be back soon. Pad Thai excellent, massuman curry delicious, satay chicken skewers were sensational, as was the chicken cashew nut stir fry. Our daughter wanted tononow how the rice tasted so good and our son demolished most of the fried rice, along with the other items. Staff happily dealt with our gluten free requirements as well.

They debate about things like the best variety of spud, whether they should plant onion or carrots in a particular field. Thanks to their love of their family farm business, it has grown from being a small potato supplier to local shops to a grower, packer and distributor to retailers nationwide. ​ Philip Sr. believes that bringing people good quality food to eat is as noble a vocation as there is.

Phy­toph­tho­ra brochure Traditional owners Abo­rig­i­nal peo­ples have occu­pied, enjoyed and man­aged the lands and waters of this State for thou­sands of gen­er­a­tions. For Abo­rig­i­nal first nations, cre­ation ances­tors laid down the laws of the Coun­try and bestowed a range of cus­tom­ary rights and oblig­a­tions to the many Abo­rig­i­nal Nations across our state. There are many places across the State that have great spir­i­tu­al sig­nif­i­cance to Abo­rig­i­nal first nations. At some of these places Abo­rig­i­nal cul­tur­al pro­to­cols, such as restrict­ed access, are pro­mot­ed and vis­i­tors are asked to respect the wish­es of Tra­di­tion­al Owners. In places where pro­to­cols are not pro­mot­ed vis­i­tors are asked to show respect by not touch­ing or remov­ing any­thing, and make sure you take all your rub­bish with you when you leave. Abo­rig­i­nal peo­ples con­tin­ue to play an active role in car­ing for their Coun­try, includ­ing in parks across South Australia. DEW Park management DEW Abo­rig­i­nal partnerships History Gran­ite Island was once con­nect­ed to the main­land. It has sur­vived the force of the ocean while the land sur­round­ing it has erod­ed away. Inter­pre­tive signs along the way reveal the ori­gin of these rocks were formed 10km below the earth­’s sur­face some 480 mil­lion years ago. Rangers recommend We have picked the brains of our park rangers to find out what they would rec­om­mend you see and do whilst vis­it­ing this park. Enjoy a whim­si­cal trip back in time and catch the unique horse drawn tram across the cause­way to the island. Enjoy the views of the wild south­ern ocean at it crash­es into the boul­ders sur­round­ing the island on a souther­ly wind. Explore the Kai­ki Trail and check out the amaz­ing for­ma­tion of Umbrel­la Rock. Go bird watch­ing and see how many dif­fer­ent vari­eties of birds you can spot. Friends of Gran­ite Island Wildlife Dis­cov­ery have put togeth­er this guide to help you along the way. Bushwalking Bush­walk­ing is a fan­tas­tic way to con­nect with nature, keep fit and spend time with fam­i­ly and friends. South Aus­trali­a’s nation­al parks fea­ture a range of trails that let you expe­ri­ence a diver­si­ty of land­scapes. Our trails cater for all lev­els of fit­ness and adven­ture and our clas­si­fi­ca­tion sys­tem makes it easy to select an expe­ri­ence suit­able for you. Walk, hike or trek — what’s the difference? Bush­walk­ing safety Park maps Grade 1 — No bush­walk­ing expe­ri­ence required, suit­able for wheel­chair users who have some­one to assist them Vic­tor Har­bor to Gran­ite Island Cause­way (20 mins one-way, 650 metres) Nav­i­gate this trail on Google Street View Take a short stroll or horse tram ride over the wood­en cause­way that con­nects the main­land at Vic­tor Har­bor to Gran­ite Island Recre­ation Park. Grade 3 — Suit­able for most ages and fit­ness levels Kai­ki Walk (1 hour, 2.9km loop) Nav­i­gate this trail on Google Street View The trail is a great way for peo­ple, includ­ing fam­i­lies with chil­dren and strollers, to dis­cov­er the island.

Dis­cov­er more about the wildlife, geol­o­gy and his­to­ry of the island with the inter­pre­tive signs along the trail. Explore gran­ite boul­ders includ­ing Umbrel­la Rock, and take in the views of Encounter Bay, the Bluff, islands and whales in winter. Granite Island Recreation Park Café The Gran­ite Island Recre­ation Park café is open dai­ly from 9:00am – 5:00pm. For fur­ther infor­ma­tion phone (08) 8429 9656. Seat­ing is avail­able with­in the café with a range of local­ly sourced pas­tries, sand­wich­es and snacks on offer. Enjoy a fresh­ly roast­ed cof­fee and soak up the stun­ning oceans views as you look across the Vic­tor Har­bor foreshore. On a warm day the grass area in front of the café is per­fect for kids, with dol­phins and sea lions often mak­ing an appear­ance in the distance. Whale watching Take your binoc­u­lars, cast your eyes out to sea and you may be lucky enough to spot a south­ern right whale between May and October. The south­ern right whales’ unique affin­i­ty for coastal inshore waters makes them the per­fect species for land-based whale watch­ing, you can eas­i­ly spend many hours view­ing their play­ful antics. Some­times the whales approach as close as 100m from shore, pro­vid­ing a bird’s eye view of their immense size and rotund, 18m body. There has been 29 dif­fer­ent types of whales record­ed in South Aus­tralia. The most com­mon are the south­ern right whale, hump­back whale, sperm whale, blue whale and orca whale (killer whale). Of these you are most like­ly to spot a south­ern right whale along the South Aus­tralian coast. The vast major­i­ty of south­ern right whales are black in colour with dis­tinc­tive white pat­terns on their heads that are cal­lus­es formed by small crus­taceans known as ​ ‘ whale lice’. The pat­terns are vis­i­ble at birth and are unique to each whale allow­ing researchers to iden­ti­fy indi­vid­ual whales. Little penguins The Lit­tle Penguin (Also known as fairy pen­guin, blue pen­guin or lit­tle blue penguin) The Lit­tle Pen­guin is the world’s small­est pen­guin species and is well known to most vis­i­tors to Australia’s south­ern coast­line. It stands about 35 cm tall and weighs about 1.2kg. By com­par­i­son the Emper­or Pen­guin, which is the largest pen­guin in the world, stands over 110 cm and can weigh 30kg. The Lit­tle Pen­guin is found only in Aus­tralia and New Zealand and is the only pen­guin to breed in Aus­tralia. Large num­bers can occur where suit­able con­di­tions are present. Lit­tle pen­guins favour rocky shore­lines, just like Gran­ite Island, which pro­vide suit­able breed­ing sites. The avail­abil­i­ty of feed­ing grounds also deter­mines the size and suc­cess of a colony. The num­ber of Lit­tle Pen­guins on Gran­ite Island has declined from 1600 pen­guins in 2001 to 20 adult pen­guins count­ed in the last cen­sus in Octo­ber 2021. Despite, the low num­ber the colony has increased from 16 pen­guins in 2020. The active bur­rows on the island are mon­i­tored with the use of remote cameras. The defin­i­tive cause of this decline is still unclear, although a 2007 PIR­SA study iden­ti­fied a num­ber of fac­tors includ­ing: changes in the marine envi­ron­ment, pre­da­tion pres­sure, and rat pre­da­tion on chicks. Study is ongo­ing on the island and a rat bait­ing pro­gram and mea­sures to pre­vent fox­es access­ing the island are cur­rent­ly in place to pro­tect the eggs and young chicks from predation. Lit­tle Pen­guins lay 2 eggs per clutch and incu­bate them for approx­i­mate­ly 36 days. Chicks fledge when they are typ­i­cal­ly 59 days post hatch­ing. Chicks are guard­ed by at least one adult for around 3 weeks fol­low­ing hatch­ing, alter­nat­ing for­ag­ing between the two adult birds. After 3 weeks both par­ents leave the chicks to for­age for food. For fur­ther inter­est­ing infor­ma­tion please see our Lit­tle pen­guins fact sheet Lit­tle Pen­guins for­age for food dur­ing the day and will return to their bur­rows dur­ing the ear­ly morn­ing and late evening. Lit­tle Pen­guins are high­ly sen­si­tive to dis­tur­bances from peo­ple and ani­mals, this can cause them to aban­don their breed­ing activ­i­ties and bur­rows and impact their sur­vival. Please adhere to the fol­low­ing guide­lines to pro­tect this vul­ner­a­ble population: Keep your dis­tance — Do not approach a pen­guin by less than 5 meters. The pen­guins always have the​‘right of way’. They are usu­al­ly return­ing to their bur­row or chicks. Don’t get between chicks and adult pen­guins or obstruct a pen­guin from get­ting to its burrow. Turn the flash set­ting off on your cam­era. A cam­era flash will blind a pen­guin for up to three days mak­ing them vul­ner­a­ble to predation. Do not use a torch unless it has been fit­ted with a red filter. Pen­guins are high­ly sen­si­tive to noise – keep your noise lev­el to a min­i­mum if you are near a pen­guin or its burrow. Dogs are not per­mit­ted on the island and fines apply. Even the smell of dogs with­in the colony will dis­turb pen­guins and may stop them from breeding. Moult­ing pen­guins may be easy to see in their bur­rows but they are most vul­ner­a­ble at this time. Their new feath­ers are not yet water­proof so they can­not leave the bur­row if disturbed. Do not touch any pen­guin, chick, eggs or bur­row as human scent may cause the pen­guins to aban­don their breed­ing activities. Mountain biking There are no des­ig­nat­ed moun­tain bik­ing trails in this park. Which parks can you ride in?

For Abo­rig­i­nal first nations, cre­ation ances­tors laid down the laws of the Coun­try and bestowed a range of cus­tom­ary rights and oblig­a­tions to the many Abo­rig­i­nal Nations across our state. There are many places across the State that have great spir­i­tu­al sig­nif­i­cance to Abo­rig­i­nal first nations. At some of these places Abo­rig­i­nal cul­tur­al pro­to­cols, such as restrict­ed access, are pro­mot­ed and vis­i­tors are asked to respect the wish­es of Tra­di­tion­al Owners. In places where pro­to­cols are not pro­mot­ed vis­i­tors are asked to show respect by not touch­ing or remov­ing any­thing, and make sure you take all your rub­bish with you when you leave. Abo­rig­i­nal peo­ples con­tin­ue to play an active role in car­ing for their Coun­try, includ­ing in parks across South Australia. DEW Park management DEW Abo­rig­i­nal partnerships History Gran­ite Island was once con­nect­ed to the main­land. It has sur­vived the force of the ocean while the land sur­round­ing it has erod­ed away. Inter­pre­tive signs along the way reveal the ori­gin of these rocks were formed 10km below the earth­’s sur­face some 480 mil­lion years ago. Rangers recommend We have picked the brains of our park rangers to find out what they would rec­om­mend you see and do whilst vis­it­ing this park. Enjoy a whim­si­cal trip back in time and catch the unique horse drawn tram across the cause­way to the island. Enjoy the views of the wild south­ern ocean at it crash­es into the boul­ders sur­round­ing the island on a souther­ly wind.

Friends of Gran­ite Island Wildlife Dis­cov­ery have put togeth­er this guide to help you along the way. Bushwalking Bush­walk­ing is a fan­tas­tic way to con­nect with nature, keep fit and spend time with fam­i­ly and friends. South Aus­trali­a’s nation­al parks fea­ture a range of trails that let you expe­ri­ence a diver­si­ty of land­scapes.

On a warm day the grass area in front of the café is per­fect for kids, with dol­phins and sea lions often mak­ing an appear­ance in the distance. Whale watching Take your binoc­u­lars, cast your eyes out to sea and you may be lucky enough to spot a south­ern right whale between May and October. The south­ern right whales’ unique affin­i­ty for coastal inshore waters makes them the per­fect species for land-based whale watch­ing, you can eas­i­ly spend many hours view­ing their play­ful antics. Some­times the whales approach as close as 100m from shore, pro­vid­ing a bird’s eye view of their immense size and rotund, 18m body. There has been 29 dif­fer­ent types of whales record­ed in South Aus­tralia. The most com­mon are the south­ern right whale, hump­back whale, sperm whale, blue whale and orca whale (killer whale). Of these you are most like­ly to spot a south­ern right whale along the South Aus­tralian coast. The vast major­i­ty of south­ern right whales are black in colour with dis­tinc­tive white pat­terns on their heads that are cal­lus­es formed by small crus­taceans known as ​ ‘ whale lice’. The pat­terns are vis­i­ble at birth and are unique to each whale allow­ing researchers to iden­ti­fy indi­vid­ual whales. Little penguins The Lit­tle Penguin (Also known as fairy pen­guin, blue pen­guin or lit­tle blue penguin) The Lit­tle Pen­guin is the world’s small­est pen­guin species and is well known to most vis­i­tors to Australia’s south­ern coast­line. It stands about 35 cm tall and weighs about 1.2kg. By com­par­i­son the Emper­or Pen­guin, which is the largest pen­guin in the world, stands over 110 cm and can weigh 30kg. The Lit­tle Pen­guin is found only in Aus­tralia and New Zealand and is the only pen­guin to breed in Aus­tralia. Large num­bers can occur where suit­able con­di­tions are present. Lit­tle pen­guins favour rocky shore­lines, just like Gran­ite Island, which pro­vide suit­able breed­ing sites. The avail­abil­i­ty of feed­ing grounds also deter­mines the size and suc­cess of a colony. The num­ber of Lit­tle Pen­guins on Gran­ite Island has declined from 1600 pen­guins in 2001 to 20 adult pen­guins count­ed in the last cen­sus in Octo­ber 2021. Despite, the low num­ber the colony has increased from 16 pen­guins in 2020. The active bur­rows on the island are mon­i­tored with the use of remote cameras. The defin­i­tive cause of this decline is still unclear, although a 2007 PIR­SA study iden­ti­fied a num­ber of fac­tors includ­ing: changes in the marine envi­ron­ment, pre­da­tion pres­sure, and rat pre­da­tion on chicks. Study is ongo­ing on the island and a rat bait­ing pro­gram and mea­sures to pre­vent fox­es access­ing the island are cur­rent­ly in place to pro­tect the eggs and young chicks from predation. Lit­tle Pen­guins lay 2 eggs per clutch and incu­bate them for approx­i­mate­ly 36 days. Chicks fledge when they are typ­i­cal­ly 59 days post hatch­ing. Chicks are guard­ed by at least one adult for around 3 weeks fol­low­ing hatch­ing, alter­nat­ing for­ag­ing between the two adult birds. After 3 weeks both par­ents leave the chicks to for­age for food. For fur­ther inter­est­ing infor­ma­tion please see our Lit­tle pen­guins fact sheet Lit­tle Pen­guins for­age for food dur­ing the day and will return to their bur­rows dur­ing the ear­ly morn­ing and late evening. Lit­tle Pen­guins are high­ly sen­si­tive to dis­tur­bances from peo­ple and ani­mals, this can cause them to aban­don their breed­ing activ­i­ties and bur­rows and impact their sur­vival. Please adhere to the fol­low­ing guide­lines to pro­tect this vul­ner­a­ble population: Keep your dis­tance — Do not approach a pen­guin by less than 5 meters. The pen­guins always have the​‘right of way’. They are usu­al­ly return­ing to their bur­row or chicks. Don’t get between chicks and adult pen­guins or obstruct a pen­guin from get­ting to its burrow. Turn the flash set­ting off on your cam­era. A cam­era flash will blind a pen­guin for up to three days mak­ing them vul­ner­a­ble to predation. Do not use a torch unless it has been fit­ted with a red filter. Pen­guins are high­ly sen­si­tive to noise – keep your noise lev­el to a min­i­mum if you are near a pen­guin or its burrow. Dogs are not per­mit­ted on the island and fines apply. Even the smell of dogs with­in the colony will dis­turb pen­guins and may stop them from breeding. Moult­ing pen­guins may be easy to see in their bur­rows but they are most vul­ner­a­ble at this time. Their new feath­ers are not yet water­proof so they can­not leave the bur­row if disturbed. Do not touch any pen­guin, chick, eggs or bur­row as human scent may cause the pen­guins to aban­don their breed­ing activities. Mountain biking There are no des­ig­nat­ed moun­tain bik­ing trails in this park. Which parks can you ride in?

DEW Park management DEW Abo­rig­i­nal partnerships History Gran­ite Island was once con­nect­ed to the main­land. It has sur­vived the force of the ocean while the land sur­round­ing it has erod­ed away. Inter­pre­tive signs along the way reveal the ori­gin of these rocks were formed 10km below the earth­’s sur­face some 480 mil­lion years ago.

On a warm day the grass area in front of the café is per­fect for kids, with dol­phins and sea lions often mak­ing an appear­ance in the distance. Whale watching Take your binoc­u­lars, cast your eyes out to sea and you may be lucky enough to spot a south­ern right whale between May and October. The south­ern right whales’ unique affin­i­ty for coastal inshore waters makes them the per­fect species for land-based whale watch­ing, you can eas­i­ly spend many hours view­ing their play­ful antics. Some­times the whales approach as close as 100m from shore, pro­vid­ing a bird’s eye view of their immense size and rotund, 18m body. There has been 29 dif­fer­ent types of whales record­ed in South Aus­tralia. The most com­mon are the south­ern right whale, hump­back whale, sperm whale, blue whale and orca whale (killer whale). Of these you are most like­ly to spot a south­ern right whale along the South Aus­tralian coast. The vast major­i­ty of south­ern right whales are black in colour with dis­tinc­tive white pat­terns on their heads that are cal­lus­es formed by small crus­taceans known as ​ ‘ whale lice’. The pat­terns are vis­i­ble at birth and are unique to each whale allow­ing researchers to iden­ti­fy indi­vid­ual whales. Little penguins The Lit­tle Penguin (Also known as fairy pen­guin, blue pen­guin or lit­tle blue penguin) The Lit­tle Pen­guin is the world’s small­est pen­guin species and is well known to most vis­i­tors to Australia’s south­ern coast­line. It stands about 35 cm tall and weighs about 1.2kg. By com­par­i­son the Emper­or Pen­guin, which is the largest pen­guin in the world, stands over 110 cm and can weigh 30kg. The Lit­tle Pen­guin is found only in Aus­tralia and New Zealand and is the only pen­guin to breed in Aus­tralia. Large num­bers can occur where suit­able con­di­tions are present. Lit­tle pen­guins favour rocky shore­lines, just like Gran­ite Island, which pro­vide suit­able breed­ing sites. The avail­abil­i­ty of feed­ing grounds also deter­mines the size and suc­cess of a colony. The num­ber of Lit­tle Pen­guins on Gran­ite Island has declined from 1600 pen­guins in 2001 to 20 adult pen­guins count­ed in the last cen­sus in Octo­ber 2021. Despite, the low num­ber the colony has increased from 16 pen­guins in 2020. The active bur­rows on the island are mon­i­tored with the use of remote cameras. The defin­i­tive cause of this decline is still unclear, although a 2007 PIR­SA study iden­ti­fied a num­ber of fac­tors includ­ing: changes in the marine envi­ron­ment, pre­da­tion pres­sure, and rat pre­da­tion on chicks. Study is ongo­ing on the island and a rat bait­ing pro­gram and mea­sures to pre­vent fox­es access­ing the island are cur­rent­ly in place to pro­tect the eggs and young chicks from predation. Lit­tle Pen­guins lay 2 eggs per clutch and incu­bate them for approx­i­mate­ly 36 days. Chicks fledge when they are typ­i­cal­ly 59 days post hatch­ing. Chicks are guard­ed by at least one adult for around 3 weeks fol­low­ing hatch­ing, alter­nat­ing for­ag­ing between the two adult birds. After 3 weeks both par­ents leave the chicks to for­age for food. For fur­ther inter­est­ing infor­ma­tion please see our Lit­tle pen­guins fact sheet Lit­tle Pen­guins for­age for food dur­ing the day and will return to their bur­rows dur­ing the ear­ly morn­ing and late evening. Lit­tle Pen­guins are high­ly sen­si­tive to dis­tur­bances from peo­ple and ani­mals, this can cause them to aban­don their breed­ing activ­i­ties and bur­rows and impact their sur­vival. Please adhere to the fol­low­ing guide­lines to pro­tect this vul­ner­a­ble population: Keep your dis­tance — Do not approach a pen­guin by less than 5 meters. The pen­guins always have the​‘right of way’. They are usu­al­ly return­ing to their bur­row or chicks. Don’t get between chicks and adult pen­guins or obstruct a pen­guin from get­ting to its burrow. Turn the flash set­ting off on your cam­era. A cam­era flash will blind a pen­guin for up to three days mak­ing them vul­ner­a­ble to predation. Do not use a torch unless it has been fit­ted with a red filter. Pen­guins are high­ly sen­si­tive to noise – keep your noise lev­el to a min­i­mum if you are near a pen­guin or its burrow. Dogs are not per­mit­ted on the island and fines apply. Even the smell of dogs with­in the colony will dis­turb pen­guins and may stop them from breeding. Moult­ing pen­guins may be easy to see in their bur­rows but they are most vul­ner­a­ble at this time. Their new feath­ers are not yet water­proof so they can­not leave the bur­row if disturbed. Do not touch any pen­guin, chick, eggs or bur­row as human scent may cause the pen­guins to aban­don their breed­ing activities.

Whale watching Main­tain­ing the legal dis­tance from marine mam­mals such as whales, dol­phins and seals is impor­tant, both for our safe­ty and that of the animals. The ani­mals may be seri­ous­ly injured if they are struck by a ves­sel or fright­ened young may become sep­a­rat­ed from their moth­ers. Even if there is no con­tact, com­ing too close can dis­rupt feed­ing, breed­ing and migra­to­ry behaviours. Reg­u­lar water users should make them­selves famil­iar with all the rules for inter­act­ing with marine mam­mals by view­ing the Nation­al Parks and Wildlife (Pro­tect­ed Ani­mals – Marine Mam­mals) Reg­u­la­tions 2010 .

It sets out the vision, future uses and development principles that will guide this exciting new residential precinct. Follow Listen This engagement is closed. Contributions to this engagement have closed. A report has been prepared on the consultation findings which can be found in the Document Library. Project Update This plan was adopted by Council on 22 June 2021. The plan sets out the background, design principles, land use and layout for the saleyards precinct (former saleyards and Target headquarters sites in North Geelong) as it transitions to a proposed mixed-use high density residential precinct. The City will now prepare a planning scheme amendment to introduce new zone and overlay controls to deliver the precinct plan. The amendment will include a public exhibition period (late 2021) and opportunities for submissions. You can see the adopted plan here OVERVIEW The City has prepared a draft Precinct Plan outlining a framework plan, design concepts and design principles for the Saleyards site. These reflect and build on the ideas shared in last year’s community vision workshop. At its meeting on Tuesday 26 May 2020, the City of Greater Geelong Council resolved to support the release of the draft Saleyards Precinct Plan for public consultation. We would love to hear what you think of the draft Precinct Plan as part of the phase 2 community consultation. This feedback will be used to further refine the Precinct Plan before it is finalised and presented to Council for adoption in mid-late 2020.

It sets out the vision, future uses and development principles that will guide this exciting new residential precinct. Follow Listen This engagement is closed. Contributions to this engagement have closed. A report has been prepared on the consultation findings which can be found in the Document Library. Project Update This plan was adopted by Council on 22 June 2021. The plan sets out the background, design principles, land use and layout for the saleyards precinct (former saleyards and Target headquarters sites in North Geelong) as it transitions to a proposed mixed-use high density residential precinct. The City will now prepare a planning scheme amendment to introduce new zone and overlay controls to deliver the precinct plan. The amendment will include a public exhibition period (late 2021) and opportunities for submissions. You can see the adopted plan here OVERVIEW The City has prepared a draft Precinct Plan outlining a framework plan, design concepts and design principles for the Saleyards site. These reflect and build on the ideas shared in last year’s community vision workshop. At its meeting on Tuesday 26 May 2020, the City of Greater Geelong Council resolved to support the release of the draft Saleyards Precinct Plan for public consultation. We would love to hear what you think of the draft Precinct Plan as part of the phase 2 community consultation. This feedback will be used to further refine the Precinct Plan before it is finalised and presented to Council for adoption in mid-late 2020.

It sets out the vision, future uses and development principles that will guide this exciting new residential precinct. Follow Listen This engagement is closed. Contributions to this engagement have closed. A report has been prepared on the consultation findings which can be found in the Document Library. Project Update This plan was adopted by Council on 22 June 2021. The plan sets out the background, design principles, land use and layout for the saleyards precinct (former saleyards and Target headquarters sites in North Geelong) as it transitions to a proposed mixed-use high density residential precinct. The City will now prepare a planning scheme amendment to introduce new zone and overlay controls to deliver the precinct plan. The amendment will include a public exhibition period (late 2021) and opportunities for submissions. You can see the adopted plan here OVERVIEW The City has prepared a draft Precinct Plan outlining a framework plan, design concepts and design principles for the Saleyards site. These reflect and build on the ideas shared in last year’s community vision workshop. At its meeting on Tuesday 26 May 2020, the City of Greater Geelong Council resolved to support the release of the draft Saleyards Precinct Plan for public consultation. We would love to hear what you think of the draft Precinct Plan as part of the phase 2 community consultation. This feedback will be used to further refine the Precinct Plan before it is finalised and presented to Council for adoption in mid-late 2020.
