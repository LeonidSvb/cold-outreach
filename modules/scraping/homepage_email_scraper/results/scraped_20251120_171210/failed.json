If you would like to learn more about Maverick Torque , check out: Dangerously Fit Indian Clubs . The steel clubbell, folks, it’s amazing, really tremendous. Let me tell you, it’s a fitness tool that goes way back, all the way to the Stone Age. Can you believe it? And now, it’s making a big comeback. Huge! This clubbell, this steel clubbell, it’s a game-changer for physical training, believe me. Unlike those useless fitness accessories out there, this steel clubbell has real benefits, tremendous benefits. It can revolutionize the way people train, believe me. You’ve got this weighted globe, welded onto a long lever. And here’s the thing, the weight distribution is uneven, so it’s a real challenge. It’s one of the oldest fitness tools, but it’s not widely used yet in gyms. We need to change that, folks. Building strong shoulders with clubs has never been easier, trust me! The benefits are tremendous, let me tell you. It’s great for shoulder resilience, grip strength, core strength, power, and those stabilizer muscles. It’s a total body workout, it teaches your body to work as a single unit. It strengthens the bond between joints and muscles, believe me. You won’t find anything like it. Now, because of the design, the weight feels heavier than those perfectly balanced dumbbells. But don’t worry, start with lighter weights and work your way up. You’ll see progress, folks. It’s all about progress. If you want to learn how to use this steel clubbell properly, you gotta consult the experts. There are great sources out there, like Dangerously Fit. They’ve got the training information, the videos, the articles. They know what they’re doing. Trust me, you’ll be in good hands. In ancient times, folks, let me tell you, men faced each other on the battlefield. They had swords, battleaxes, war-hammers, and heavy maces, deadly weapons, believe me. But here’s the thing, folks, those weapons did more than just cause destruction. They gave the wielder incredible core strength and shoulder mobility. And let me tell you, that’s what we’re after in our modern world. We’re not just talking about smashing heads like squashed cantaloupes, no, no, we want that core strength and mobility. Credit: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/1446078689\/adjustable-mace-bell-bamboo-loadable And that’s where the clubbell comes in, folks, it’s something special. It’s better than swords or war hammers, let me tell you why. You can adjust the weight quickly and easily, it’s fantastic. And I have to mention the Maverick Club, it’s a brand new, fully adjustable tool for warming up and clubbell-specific training. It’s tremendous! Now, let’s talk about who benefits from clubbell training. We’re not just saying everybody, although it’s great for everybody, folks. We’re talking about specific groups here. We’re talking about rotational sports like hockey, golf, tennis, lacrosse, baseball, and softball. Those sports where you swing something, you know what I mean? Now, in these sports, there are muscular imbalances, unavoidable really. But let me tell you, those imbalances can affect your performance and lead to injuries, and we don’t want that. Clubbell training, my friends, it helps minimize those imbalances, keeps you healthy, and boosts your performance in your sport. It’s a game-changer, believe me. When it comes to warmups and preparation, clubbell training fits right into your strength training warmup. It’s fantastic, folks. You get a wide range of movements that bring so many benefits. But remember, safety and effectiveness are key. So, you might be asking yourself… “where do I find such training tools”? The answer is simple, go to Google and search “ clubbells on Amazon “…. and you’ll find hundreds! A Turkish wrestling team nearly 100 years ago set out to invent a functional training total-body kettlebell movement that would prime young athletes for competition – an exercise that builds stamina and flexibility, improves stability and strength. For over a hundred years, Turkish wrestlers have sought to create an exercise that will prime young athletes for competition. This total-body movement builds stamina and flexibility while improving stability and strength in all parts of the body – it’s perfect preparation! The kettlebell Turkish get-up was born. It’s a wrestler’s best friend and the key to unlocking an endless amount of possibilities in any sport that requires you be on your feet for long periods, like Muay Thai or wrestling! The first thing one must do when executing this technique is lie flat with arms extended overhead, so they form two lines pointing towards ceiling while remaining as close together at shoulders without allowing them touch. Because if done incorrectly then there will not only feel pain but may also end up getting hurt even worse than before since it could lead into serious back injuries down the line which nobody wants right? For those looking to get up off the ground, there is an exercise that will help. As kettlebell legend goes it was created by Pavel Tsatsouline who introduced kettlebell training into America and with just one single movement can be used for everything from weight loss or gaining muscle mass in your legs all while improving balance! He sat back, crossed his arms and said “It’s all in the wrists. You can get up anytime you want.” The man looked to be around 50 years old but there was no mistaking that face – it’s Pavel Tsatsouline! “As legend goes,” says this famous American kettlebell coach with a wealth-of knowledge on how best conduct oneself when fighting against gravity or not: “A guy walks into my gym who couldn’t complete one military press without dropping them both times; he did 20 rep squat Chicano style before finally asking me if I had any advice for him.” It’s a good thing kettlebell Turkish get-ups haven’t been around for very long. If they had, the smartest people in fitness might have forgotten all about them by now I can only imagine what would happen if we were to embrace an exercise regimen that spans centuries and is still somehow as effective today! The kettlebell get-up is an exercise that targets muscles in the body not usually developed through traditional strength training. It can help you achieve your fitness goals and build immunity to injury! Performing get-ups regularly will make you more powerful. The move is great for targeting muscles that traditional strength exercises leave out, and it can be done anywhere with just your body weight! I suggest you perform this movement with a powder coated kettlebell to give you better grip on the kettlebell. Get ups are the most intimidating obstacle course in bar space. It takes a certain level of courage, patience and skill to complete just one! But don’t worry — as with any new skills there’s always practice that makes you better at balancing an unwieldy metal orb above your head while going through seven steps (not including getting up). If you have ever thought about adding some variety to your workout, then power bags are an excellent way for those who want something more than just weights. Sand is also great because it’s easy on the joints so even people without much experience can do them! The many uses for power bags are limited only by your imagination. They can be used as a rebound in shooting ranges, or filled with water and kicked around on the beach to build up some tension before competition time begins! A great way make any home gym more fun? Try out this new addition—power bag have been proven effective across different types of athletes from Olympic lifters right down casual backyard warriors like you an me. Power bags are a cool way to work on your grip and core while also getting some arm strength. Sand-filled canvas bags fill with sand that you can throw, pack down or pancake pounds out of them! You can do all sorts drills – even Russian Twist Pushups if need be in order get those arms moving. So what’s the catch? No catches here friends — these things just plain old work. It’s time to shake up your abdominal workout routine. Why not try power bags? They’re a fun piece of equipment that will complement any home gym—and many forward-thinking gyms have them available as well! When you think of workout gear, do they not make the perfect accessory? power bags seem to be coming back in a big way. This time around there’s no need for black nor green because instead we have pink sandboxes that are shiny and new! Power bags seem to have a strong comeback into the fitness world. I say it’s because they are actually not anything new—just coming back in a slightly different look (hello, pink shiny power bag!). When I was in high school, we used to use power bags a lot. Our coach had this great idea of cutting inner tube halves and filling them with sand so they would be tough enough for any exercise you could think of! You should try it too if that sounds like something your workout needs, the best part is how simple these things can really get made from just an old spare tire around here (I’m never without one). The power bag is a versatile tool that can be used for many things, including weight training and rehabilitation. Here are some awesome reasons why you should workout with one: * You get intense cardio workouts because of how much work your heart has to do when lifting them * They offer an amazing full body resistance exercise without having find multiple items like free weights or discs; it’s just thrown over either shoulder! This means no wasted movement while doing other exercises in order target specific areas on particular days. Full body multi-joint exercises are a great way to give your muscles all the benefits of heavy weights without sacrificing form. With these kinds of moves, you can do more work in less time and get faster results! Power bags in Australia can be found online, make sure you choose a company that has many satisfied customers. The best part about this workout is that you can take it with me anywhere. I wear the duffel bag on my shoulder as if it were a purse, and then when we get to our destination all of my worries are gone because there’s no more need for backpacks or purses! With its small size, the self-focused design is perfect for those who want some quality outdoor time. You can take it with you on your morning walk or even use this machine outside at a park! You’ll never be happier than when you take your new workout buddy outside for some fresh air and exercise. It can go with you anywhere, so it doesn’t matter if there are no facilities nearby! You can use additional weight in your sandbag workouts . I love bodyweight exercises, but sometimes it’s nice to lift some heavier stuff! 80 pounds is a good starting point for me and the weights are adjustable–you just take one filler bag out if you want less resistance or put them back when desired level has been reached.

Using less oil, going in for more fresh foods, fruits and vegetables and lean meats, all these will help you to not only keep your weight down, but also keep you in better shape. If you are not too sure of the types of food you should eat especially when exercising, check with an experienced personal trainer.

If you have alcohol, ensure that you drink in moderation. At any time if you feel you are approaching addictional level you can always discuss ways and means to control such a situation with a personal trainer.

If you have been considering taking your fitness instructor exams or are about to take it sometime soon, some tips may help you crack it with flying colours. Here’s what you can keep in mind, Practice Tests Get hold of as many practice tests as you can. Ask other fitness instructors who have fitness instructor certifications in your place of work for additional reference material or old practice tests that can help. Practice tests will help you to understand the test format and the kind of questions instructors are tested with. You can accordingly spend a few weeks practicing these answers before the final test. Knowing your test format and the kind of questions that will come will help you to finish the test faster and gain confidence too. Practical Help If you have other instructors in your place of work with relevant fitness instructor certifications from nz.ptcertifications.com – personal training courses you can always ask them for practical help. Ask them how they prepared and what they did to pass the exams. Guidance from professionals will always help you get ahead faster. Take Model Tests Before you give the exams, try to take mock tests . Time yourself and see what topics you aren’t being able to crack well. If you know your weak points before giving the exam, you will have adequate time to prepare yourself and crack the final exam. Study Efficiently Efficient studying involves studying your text books and teaming it with practical experience. Keep asking questions when you study. Do not just refer to one resource to get your facts right. Keep researching on other mediums online and other platforms to ensure you are well prepared by the end of it all. A little at a time A common mistake many people make when giving exams is cramming up at the last moment. And this affects their ability to take the exams well. It is important to prepare over a period of time and a little at a time. This will help you retain what you have learnt for longer. Understand the Question When taking mock exams, read and understand the questions well and prepare your answers in your head before writing them down. Sometimes, people do not understand the question or don’t read it carefully enough. They end up writing unnecessary features in the answers or marking the wrong answer in a multiple-choice format as a result. Be patient When practicing for your exams or when giving the exam, be patient. Do not rush through your exam or study. This will help you succeed better in the exams.

The shouts, the yelling all this seem to be pretty intimidating, but in reality the fitness expert is constantly keeping you motivated. This source of encouragement proves to be extremely fruitful for you. When you are working out on your own, you lack motivation.

Excellent accommodations. Great variety of breakfast items provided. Good location. Netherlands Michel 9,0 Sangat bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Allendale House Great, simple as that. Very luxurious in a real living area. You get a complete floor to use. Free fruit and readily available breakfast was really nice. Great place even with our aarly arrival with a jetlag kicking in. Minor point but there is no real outside available. Singapore Poh 10,0 Bagus sekali Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Allendale House Comfortable, peaceful and felt like home. Great location. Within walking distance to many nice cafes and restaurants. The property is clean, tidy and quiet. Owners are very helpful and friendly. This is the second time I booked and stayed there. So obviously it is on top of my booking list if I travel to Auckland. I love everything, so I guess there is nothing for me to feedback in this section really. However if your driving skill is borderline, don't rent a huge SUV and try to drive down the driveway. Just park along the road up there. It is free anyway. Canada Christopher 10,0 Bagus sekali Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Allendale House Highly recommended Friendly and welcoming hosts, beautiful decor, exceptionally clean, and a great healthy breakfast! Germany Mehly 9,0 Sangat bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Allendale House Exceptional We had a really nice stay, Sharon and James are nice, welcoming and considerate hosts. Singapore Poh 10,0 Bagus sekali Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Allendale House Felt so at home and welcomed. Everything just turned out to be perfect. Very clean and tidy. Shower water pressure and temperature are perfect. Bed is comfortable. To have the whole of 2nd level with lounge to myself was awesome. Great location for my business trip. Most importantly, James and Sharon are very friendly and helpful. Will definitely stay there again when I visit Auckland. There is nothing not to like about this property. Guest who opted for home stay should have good etiquette and habit to make the stay a pleasant one for both the guest and owners. This is not a 5-Star hotel establishment. It is a 5-Star cozy home stay that will make you feel welcomed. Australia Vanessa 9,0 Sangat bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Allendale House Good location and very clean! Very clean and the hosts were very accommodating. Lovely little touches like fruit, chocolate and loads of different types if tea. The breakfast was continental so there was muesli, yoghurt, dried apricots & nuts, fruit, cheese & biscuits, fresh juices etc. The location was perfect for the local restaurants and beaches. Parking was available down their drive, great for small\/ mid range size but not for large cars however there is parking on the road up the drive. Just a little niggle but my husband found the bed too short and it was a little hard. Can't please everyone's tastes though. New Zealand Vicki 10,0 Bagus sekali Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Allendale House Fantastic. Would have loved to stay longer. Lovely hosts. Fantastic house and close to the village. All the extra touches breakfast ,chocolate,fruit etc were amazing. Would definitely recommend. Australia Mteurope 8,0 Sangat bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Allendale House Very well appointed B&B Stayed two-nights in this very well appointed accommodation which was close to Howick shops and beach. Everything you need is supplied along with beautiful and comfortable furnishings and a very good breakfast. Hosts are friendly and professional, not too attentive nor too distant. Unfortunately, when we arrived we discovered a dog and two cats share the premises and there is no way to close off the upstairs area from the rest of the house. For someone anxious around animals as I am, this meant keeping the doors to the bedroom and loungeroom closed at all times which was inconvenient. It could be a bigger issue if you are allergic to animals. Not knowing about the dog and cats before arriving. They didn't end up being an issue when we were there but I would never choose to stay at a place where pets can access the guest area. Hong Kong Carl 10,0 Bagus sekali Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Allendale House Exceptional Great location and a small apartment style accommodation upstairs. United Kingdom Vicki 10,0 Bagus sekali Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Allendale House It was a home from home and Sharon and James were so so welcoming. I felt so relaxed at their apartment, it is just gorgeous and a great amount of space just to yourself, the location was fab with restaurants and shops nearby and the bed was just incredible!!! So nice with the touches of the food in the fridge, and cereal and tea bags etc. Was very sad to leave there if I am honest. Definitely go here if you want somewhere out of the way to relax after a long flight or a lot of travelling around. Perfect! Nothing! New Zealand Napier 10,0 Bagus sekali Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Allendale House The little extra touches were lovely. Very quiet and perfect location. The shower was excellent and the room very comfortable with a lovely breakfast. Nothing Argentina Gustavo 9,0 Sangat bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Allendale House Nice beach nearby, quiet neighbourhood. Nice house! Nice owners! Little bit away from downtown, but 10 min away from ferry that links directly to City! New Zealand Katherine 9,0 Sangat bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Allendale House Lots of extras like fruit bowl and cake added a nice touch No faults. Good local facilities and handy for half moon bay footferry into downtown Auckland. Took the stress out of driving\/ parking in the city. Spain María 10,0 Bagus sekali Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Allendale House We just loved it, so clean and so spacious, with all the upper part of the house for us. They este lovely people and in just one days they had lots of details with us. Pity we were exhausted after a 35h tríp. We loved everything. New Zealand Anthony 10,0 Bagus sekali Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Allendale House I was looking for somewhere close to where I was attending a convention. James & Sharon's place had some good reviews so that helped me decide to book. The reviews didn't do their B&B justice! Everything a solo (or couple) traveler could want (or need) for a short stay was thought off. Having the entire 1st floor with an office, sitting room, bathroom and of course bedroom (with a very comfortable bed and pillows!) was absolutely first rate. Very nice touch of a welcoming card and some very tasty chocolate. I can't recommend Allendale House highly enough! New Zealand Cheryl 10,0 Bagus sekali Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Allendale House All of the hospitality details at the home of Sharon and James showed thoughtfulness and care, and it was much appreciated. Birdsong in the morning was a delight, as was the coffee. And plenty of room to enjoy it all. Australia Jade 10,0 Bagus sekali Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Allendale House It was was really well set up. We were given complementary chocolate which was delicious and a lovely gesture. Couldnt fault them. First time time stayimg at a BnB and i would definitely do it again. New Zealand Jain 10,0 Bagus sekali Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Allendale House We were warmly welcomed. Very clean, pretty and comfortable. Had the top floor to ourselves, with separate sitting room, very comfy double bed, and very clean and functional bathroom. There were several very nice personal touches, such as a welcome card and a bar of Donovan's chocolate. All in a very pretty location and within a short walk to shops, cafes etc. Superb value! Nothing United Kingdom Ventseslav 10,0 Bagus sekali Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Allendale House This was one of our best stays in New Zealand. James and Sharon are amazing hosts. We've got the whole second floor of the house for ourslevs. Living room, bedroom , bathroom and a study. The internet was very fast and they had Sky which kept us busy for a while :) The bed was super comfortable and eveyrthing was decorated in a cosy rustic way. We had a small handwriten postcard and a Manuca honey chocolate left for us when we checked in. It was super kind and we felt very welcomed and at home. Thank you James and Sharon!

    "homepage_content":"The Historic Empire Hotel – Sharing Hotels – Sharing is caring! Skip to content No results CHECK PRICES The Historic Empire Hotel in Ross is a well-known West Coast landmark with a strong sense of local history and personality. Originally built in 1866, it was rebuilt in 1908 after a fire, with an exterior of wood and corrugated iron – fireproof and practical for the gold rush town. Today, it’s a lively pub that reflects over a century of Ross’s history. Location Situated on Aylmer Street just across from the Ross Historic Goldfields & Heritage Centre, the Empire Hotel is in the heart of the town’s historic core. It’s a gathering spot for locals and visitors alike. Dining & Bar The hotel offers full buffet lunches for groups and individuals, serving hearty and satisfying food. The bar opens at 12 p.m. and stays open until midnight. Most nights, you can enjoy a buffet dinner or fish and chips. On Fridays, the pub is famous for burger nights, and on Sundays, they serve a traditional roast with homemade desserts. It’s a place where good food and a relaxed atmosphere combine. The Atmosphere & History Inside, the walls are decorated with local history – banknotes hanging from the ceiling, old photos, hunting trophies, and lumps of coal tell the story of Ross’s gold rush past. The hotel feels unchanged over the years, with a cozy fire to warm up near during colder nights. Every Sunday, there’s live music in the garden bar, and on the last Friday of each month, visitors can bring an instrument for a jam session. Accommodation & Facilities The hotel has a range of options: in-house rooms with private ensuites, shared facility rooms, hostel-style backpacker accommodation, and camping sites with shared kitchens, showers, and laundry. This variety makes it suitable for travelers on different budgets or those wanting a simple overnight stay or longer-term option. What Makes It Special This pub is one of the last authentic “bawdy” establishments remaining in Ross – truly a survivor of the gold rush era. Its warm atmosphere, rich history, and lively community events make it more than just a place to eat and drink; it’s a piece of local heritage. Overall The Empire Hotel offers an authentic West Coast pub experience – good food, history, music, and a friendly, relaxed crowd. It’s ideal for those wanting to soak up local history while enjoying hearty meals and a lively atmosphere. Pros and Cons Pros: ✔ Historic building with a real gold rush atmosphere ✔ Wide range of accommodations: rooms, shared facilities, backpacker and camping sites ✔ Regular live music and community events ✔ Full buffet lunch and dinner, Sunday roasts, and Friday burger nights ✔ Friendly atmosphere with lots of character ✔ Close to Ross Goldfields & Heritage Centre Cons: ✘ Some rooms have shared facilities, which may not suit everyone ✘ Not a luxury hotel – basic and authentic experience ✘ Limited modern amenities and comfort features Overall, the Empire Hotel in Ross is a true West Coast experience – rich in history, friendly in spirit, and perfect for travelers wanting an authentic pub and lodge experience in a historic gold rush town.

There were notes throughout the house with notes 'not to do this and not to do that. Including not using the upstairs bathroom after 10pm because it was beside the hosts room. New Zealand Anonymous 2,0 Menyenangkan Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari DREAM HOMES - AUCKLAND CITY Nothing all This house was very dirty as they did not clean used dishes and This house have so many rules but they did not display in adversement.

New Zealand Lindsay 5,0 Bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari DREAM HOMES - AUCKLAND CITY Angel was very pleasant Didn't realise this was more like a transient boarding house there were many others sharing this smaller accomadation too.it wasn't as clean as one would expect in good area. Out in busy street to park your car .hit and miss to get one close Australia Anonymous 7,0 Bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari DREAM HOMES - AUCKLAND CITY Angel is lovely and looks after you. The bed is comfortable and the room is clean. The host provides water, biscuits, a towel and free Wifi for you. A bathroom is close to your room. If you've got a car a parking space is available on the street. It's slightly further from the city and the airport. You can hear everything in your room. It's overpriced. I can get a bigger, trendier room for the same price. Argentina Raul 7,0 Bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari DREAM HOMES - AUCKLAND CITY muy hospitalarios. siempre atentos a las necesidades Chile Benjamin 2,0 Menyenangkan Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari DREAM HOMES - AUCKLAND CITY El WiFi Todo el resto United Kingdom Peter 8,0 Sangat bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari DREAM HOMES - AUCKLAND CITY Metro bus 267 to Queen Street stop is just yards away, Sky Bus to and from airport has a stop about 1 kilometre from the property as well. Right next to the motorway for anyone who is driving. Angel the proprietor is very helpful and it's handy having a kitchen available to make your own coffee! Very basic but if you're looking for cheap accommodation for a few nights with easy access to the centre this would be hard to beat. New Zealand Pat 3,0 Menyenangkan Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari DREAM HOMES - AUCKLAND CITY the location was good in relationship to the airport if they knew how to make a bed, towel oldest possible only good for rag, shower unbelievably dirty , has NEVER been cleaned. absolutely black on the base. notices everwhere, dont do this or that- terrible approach the house appears to be ready for remake or demolition only curtains hand instead of doors or cupboard doors Australia Emma 7,0 Bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari DREAM HOMES - AUCKLAND CITY It is close to shops, laundry mat, banks and food places. Parking is free on the opposite side of the road. The owner is easy to contact and is quick to respond. They got us milo because we don't drink tea or coffee (I stated it in additional comments when booking) we were the only guests at the time. The shower had good pressure and nice hot water. Owner helpful with how to get to places. The shared kitchen didn't have a microwave and the stove and oven had tape over the knobs signaling to not use it. The fan switch for the bathroom was not in the bathroom it was in our room so we had to remember to turn it on before we got into the shower. The mattress on the bed felt like I was sleeping in a ditch. ( I notified the owner and they are going to look into it.) we didn't know how the bed was made the sheets looked like they were just placed on and was not made the way that I've seen before. New Zealand Alan 6,0 Bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari DREAM HOMES - AUCKLAND CITY It was quite close to the airport and our camper pickup location The kitchen did not have a functioning oven and had a lot of washed dishes left on the draining board. It didn't look that clean. There was a dirty electric fryer of some kind on the worktop. To be fair, the owner was very friendly and did offer us use of her kitchen. I've put the pics of tge kitchen below but under the wrong category as I wanted to include them. The room was also very damp and cold. The front door was left open for long periods of time because of this. New Zealand Jenson 5,0 Bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari DREAM HOMES - AUCKLAND CITY The property is a big house. The owners are very helpful. It was dirty. There were dust mites in the room. Although I was given an alternative room and allowed cancelation. I was charged for having stayed there one night. Not having anywhere to go. It was only after I showed the owner a video clip of the crawling insects did she ask me to find other accommodation. It was sad I had to pay 80 dollars for staying one night where I could not sleep. I also have taken a photo of the shower cubicle that appears to be layered with years of grime. There was no toiletries. Sad properties like this are allowed to function. New Zealand Pam 2,0 Menyenangkan Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari DREAM HOMES - AUCKLAND CITY Felt like I was intruding and an inconvenience to the host. The host was not very helpful, and you have to be very quiet speaking. Couldn't use the loo after 10pm. (there is a note) When you did to to the loo the lid wasn't attached very well, and left up by other guests. Eeww! Never again.

L'accueil dans l'endroit, est un peu léger, la réception est sale et tout le building est sale, ça sent la cigarette dans les lieux communs, la chambre a part ce que vous voyez au premier abord était sale (sauf le lit le sol et les serviettes) sinon derrière la télé beaucoup de poussière, la douche et les toilettes étaient sale la cuisine et la vaisselle étaient sale, pas de lumière dans la salle de bain et la lampe de chevet cassée, le chauffage casse, la télécommande capricieuse, le téléphone sale. Un manque certain de nettoyage en profondeur des lieux, ce qui est dommage car l'endroit pourrait être très agréable. Le réceptionniste, ne se souciaient pas trop du fait que la lampe soit cassée !

Chile Maca 1,0 Pleasant Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What was the highlight of Empire Apartments Muy mal La verdad es que fue decepcionante la estadía en Empire Apartments,. No reflejaba en absoluto las imágenes mostradas por Booking. Quiero partir explicando que desde el momento que llegamos a realizar el check in la atención fue muy mala, una vez que nos acercamos para el check in no obtuve saludo cordial, la persona se encontraba hablando por teléfono en vez de encargarse de solucionar el problema, nos hacen esperar sin dar ningún tipopo de explicación. Llegamos a las 5 pm y la habitación no se encontraba lista ni limpia, los basureros sin cambiar y con envases de jeringa lo que es muy desagradable y poco higiénico. La cocina muy sucia todos los espacios en deplorables condiciones.

Sehr gross und geräumig. Kleines Frühstück wurde offeriert. Bischen weit weg von der Stadt wenn man sich nicht auskennt. Wenig Besteck. Deutschland Michael 10,0 Bagus sekali Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari East Coast Guesthouse Sehr sehr freundliche Vermieter. Sie sind sehr hilfsbereit und haben tolle Tipps. Lage im Norden von Auckland war für uns perfekt. New Zealand Warren 9,0 Sangat bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari East Coast Guesthouse The hosts were very hospitable and accomodating to our requests. The driveway was quite narrow and you had to back out, which was sometimes difficult v New Zealand Duncan 10,0 Bagus sekali Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari East Coast Guesthouse Great place to stay for a couple of nights whilst attending a course at North Shore Hospital. Friendly hosts. Parking and Wifi included. Breakfast cereals and toast were included. Tasty homemade Anzac buiscuits! New Zealand Melissa 10,0 Bagus sekali Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari East Coast Guesthouse The hosts were very accommodating and hospitable. Daily breakfast was a bonus, which we didn’t expect, and supplied everything we needed during our stay. United Kingdom Mathilde 10,0 Bagus sekali Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari East Coast Guesthouse Very comfortable and clean apartment with all the amenities you could wish for. Hosts couldn’t be more helpful and friendly. Breakfast was definitely a plus for us as well as all the advice on our itinerary. Would definitely recommend over a conventional hotel! Nothing! Australia Richard 9,0 Sangat bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari East Coast Guesthouse The apartment was spacious and the Hosts, Peter and Charmaine were lovely. They set up the sofa bed for our young daughter and the bed in the main bedroom was very comfortable. We had queries re public transport and Peter organised a travel card for us - which was so unexpected and much appreciated. Breakfast food in the fridge was a nice touch. There wasn't much not to like. The location is probably a bit further out of the city than we expected - it was our first trip to NZ. However public transport was literally right at the front door and it was lovely taking the ferry home at night. New Zealand Claire 10,0 Bagus sekali Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari East Coast Guesthouse The entire place was great and Peter was a great host! I must say the photos undersell what the place actually looks like, which was immaculate. I wasn’t entirely sure before coming whether or not the bathroom is private, which it is (in case anyone else is also unsure). The place was clean, tidy, had everything we needed (and more). There were nice touches that I didn’t expect such as Connect Four and yoghurt in the fridge. Would definitely recommend staying here There was a slight kerfuffle before we came over as there was an accidental double booking of the room which worried us initially, but Peter sorted it out and we were able to stay. New Zealand Ms 10,0 Bagus sekali Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari East Coast Guesthouse Charlaine was an awesome host. Her house was lovely and very comfy, with all the facilities you ll need for a short stay. What s more the breakfast was excellent too! You will not be able to find a better host \/ guesthouse anywhee! New Zealand Darren 9,0 Sangat bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari East Coast Guesthouse the hosts were so helpful, the flat is a little home away from home. we had some vehicle dramas and peter sorted us out above and beyond what ive ever experienced and we travel alot United States of America Gail 10,0 Bagus sekali Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari East Coast Guesthouse Our hosts, Charmaine and Peter, could not have been friendlier or more accommodating. They gave us information about public transportation as well as suggestions for dining and touring. The apartment was large, with two sofas, television, and a kitchen that included a refrigerator and microwave, as well as a place to cook, if we so desired. Very comfortable! The only thing is location, if you want to be withing walking distance of Auckland sites. If one is driving, it is about 15 minutes into Auckland. The town of Milford is within walking distance (great selection of restaurants). The bus comes regularly to take one into the city of Auckland, so transport to and from the city is not really a problem. We enjoyed being in a smaller community. New Zealand Swinglet 10,0 Bagus sekali Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari East Coast Guesthouse We were greeted by the owners, a lovely couple who went above and beyond what they needed to, to make our stay as hassle free as possible.Provided for a last minute additional guest and were very hospitable.

It was close to the CBD and supermarket and communication with the landlords was excellent. We will be back. I didn’t like the struggle to find the car park. It would be good if it was labelled with the address. However, the landlords helped us find it immediately. United States of America Anonymous 10,0 Bagus sekali Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Fisher Point - Shared Apartment Liked size of bedroom and apartment. Great access to transportation and downtown Auckland, very walkable. Amount of stairs to access apartment unit (couldn't be helped). Was told in earlier e-mail from owner to call her from airport after arrival to meet us for early check-in. However, upon arrival, was told by partner we had to wait until regular check-in time, three hours later. Waited for owner at front door. United States of America Leanne 10,0 Bagus sekali Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Fisher Point - Shared Apartment Very spacious, modern and stylish apartment within easy walking distance of the city center and harbor. A large deck with patio table and chairs has a very nice view of the city. There are three rooms, each rented separately. The bathroom and living space is shared. The neighborhood felt very safe, modern, and well-kept. The owner (who does not live on the premises) was friendly, and good about communication. Definitely recommended!! Australia Rafik 10,0 Bagus sekali Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Fisher Point - Shared Apartment Clean and very comfortable kitchen well equipped bathroom very tidy and plenty of towels.

New Zealand Ash 9,0 Sangat bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Fisher Point - Shared Apartment Nicely made bed. Love the fact that they had a pool and gym. And quiet surrounding. Just the city noise which I like. Umm, nothing to complain about. What I expected was there.

The appart is very clean and sharing it with strangers is No problems at all! United States of America Kathleen 9,0 Sangat bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Fisher Point - Shared Apartment The WI-fi did not connect. Could not figure out TV. Poor instructions for finding location. Could not get in because other guest took my set of keys. Poor communication. New Zealand Anonymous 9,0 Sangat bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Fisher Point - Shared Apartment The owners were extremely helpful. They ensured I arrived safely and checked on me as I was staying there by myself for the first night. When requested they brought around an exra towel and helped one of the other guests with his safe. I could not work out how to turn the outside light off so it was a little bright to sleep but after a long day it really didnt bother me New Zealand Anonymous 8,0 Sangat bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Fisher Point - Shared Apartment We didn't realise that we would have to share the bathroom. Would have preferred to pay extra for the en-suite bathroom. The only accommodation we've everstayed in that charges a room cleaning fee. This adds to the total cost so the room is not as cheap as it would seem. United States of America Dana 8,0 Sangat bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Fisher Point - Shared Apartment Host met me right as I arrived to give me a tour and the key. Even helped me with my bag! The apartment was clean and well appointed, I really appreciated the washer and dryer too. There is a full kitchen available for use and the property was nice and quiet. It is located near a park a little outside of the CBD in a nice neighborhood. can't think of much, other than you'll want to get an uber\/taxi from the CBD airport shuttle stop. And just FYI it takes about a 10-15 min walk to get to bars, entertainment, etc. although a supermarket is a block away which was great. Nouvelle-Calédonie Marie 9,0 Sangat bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Fisher Point - Shared Apartment Excellente situation géographique. Au pied de Victoria Park et à seulement 10min à pied de Queen St comme Ponsonby! Quartier très calme, petit bonus : accès piscine & salle sport Appartement au goût très soigné, chambre avec salle de bain privative impeccable! Vue sur la sky tower du balcon!

From Our Guests Kirstie \"This was a stay to enjoy a much needed rest over the Easter Break from hard physical work and also to complete a 6 month course which included a virtual retreat via zoom for a large portion of 2 days of our stay. It was absolutely perfect for both. It was quiet. The internet wifi was faultless. The spa pool was incredible, best I've ever been in. It was secluded. There were other guests in the house during our stay but it did not impede on our space or seclusion at all. Management was exceptional. Loved the experience. It made such an impression I still think about it often and will definitely go again.\" - Homeaway NZ April 2022 Sonja, Marianne + Susanne (Australia\/Germany) We had the most wonderful time. This place is just amazing......just everything about it. The only negative is that we are not staying for longer. There is a high likelihood that we'll be back! Sue Burchell Excellent facilities, really clean. Very good communication with hosts. Good location for exploring the area by car. (Suite C - From NZ Holiday Homes review.) Cdfrenay Words don't describe the welcoming arrival to Coastal Cottages. Soft lighting, music, and a warm greeting. We've been overseas for 2 months, and this last stay is the highlight of our travels. We really did save the best for last. (Suite C - From Tripadvisor review.) Mara + Axel (Auckland) We had a great time, we enjoyed the beautiful view, the warm welcome and this beautiful house. We were lucky to have spent New Year here with all our friends. Thank you for your hospitality. (Suite C - From our Guest Book.) Richard R (Washington) Quiet, clean, spacious. An expansive view of the valley with just a bit of the harbor in the distance. Very helpful and friendly hosts. Add in a hot tub and a well equipped kitchen and we could easily spend a week here as we enjoyed the north island.. (From TripAdvisor.) Lovey (NZ) The large spaces indoor and out catered perfectly for our whanau. Stunning views from the main deck especially sunset. The spa was a hit for everyone and was utilised well. The lounge pull out sofa beds, indoor fire, easy access to wifi and huge tv provided the best home theatre for the kids during the evenings. Loved our stay and highly recommend the Coastal Chalet Suites... (From Facebook.) Sarah (NZ) Coastal Chalet's Suite C was an absolutely perfect getaway for a couple! We had a lovely time in the peace and quiet with the spa...bliss! Wendy was so kind as to leave me a lovely local soap as a birthday gift! How lucky we were to be able to stay at such a great place, I 100% recommend it to anyone, you will have an amazing time!! Tai (NZ) Best decision we made was to get out of Auckland (for a weekend) and stay here. AirBNB - August 2021. Helyar (NZ) Amaaazing setting, beautifully clean, well-kitted, comfortable, helpful manager. Would stay again. Holiday Homes - August 2021. Ant + Laura (Australia) \"Thank you for your lovely hospitality. We loved staying here, although not long enough. We will always think of this as a very special place as it is where we got engaged! Couldn't have asked for a more beautiful setting and we will most definitely be back for a longer stay.\" Christine Had the best stay in Suite C chalet.

Shop For Cookies Our Story It all began when I was 8 years old... I wrote on my Bucket List that I wanted to own my own Cookie Shop one day. Growing up in a solo-mother family with very little, I remember how happy a simple cookie dunked in cold milk made me. So at 21 years old & inspired by my childhood, Moustache Milk & Cookie Bar was born. Moustache is for the young and the young at heart. For the child in all of us who takes joy in the simple things. Moustache is for you Mum. Shop For Cookies Our Ingredients Small Shop, Big Heart We’re a little milk and cookie bar with a huge passion for baking the freshest and yummiest cookies around town. You can’t make good cookies with bad ingredients. That’s the way the cookie crumbles. So at Moustache we don’t skimp on the good stuff. We use free-range eggs, real NZ butter, premium Dutch cocoa and plenty of delicious Whittakers chocolate with no use of additives or preservatives. Vegan? We’ve got you covered! Delicious Vegan Cookie Pies & Giant Cookies so nobody misses out! Take Me There! Vegan? We’ve got you covered! We have a wide selection of Vegan cookies and products that cater to your unique needs!

The bed was super comfy! I think I was initially a little disappointed as the pictures and description made it seem like it was more cottage like and that it had an appealing outdoor space you could use. In the end this didn’t really matter to us as we were only really there to sleep, however I think if you we’re around more during the day on a nice day this would have been more of an issue. It ended up being great for our needs though. Australia Barry 7,0 Bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Peggie's Cottage Good It was very clean. Plenty of crockery and cutlery were available. There was a very large refrigerator and two washing machines but no dryer. Condiments such as sauces were supplied as well as coffee but no tea bags or milk. The property suits a couple, small family or backpacking friends. It is small and intimate, so is not suitable for sharing with a complete stranger.

Mark has always been straight up and honest in every aspect, hence why I trust him. I thoroughly recommend Mark and the team at Pukekohe Toyota to anyone in the market for a new vehicle.” Craig Lipscombe “…Pukekohe Toyota would be the first place I would call” “If I ever buy another car Pukekohe Toyota would be the first place I would call on. Friendly, honest and patient are a few descriptive words I can use to describe my experience with them. Thank you, Pukekohe Toyota!” Noel Lumsden “… I am so grateful I chose Pukekohe Toyota” “I truly have never received such amazing service from any company as I did from Pukekohe Toyota, and particularly Glenn Begbie. When you’re a woman buying a car, you can feel very vulnerable, and I can say that I was treated with the utmost respect. I was searching for a Signature Class Toyota Corolla. 5-star safety rating, economical, and inexpensive to maintain. I was looking for the unicorn! From my initial email right through to the delivery, Glenn went above and beyond. He dropped my chosen car to the alarm guy as arranged, and then he delivered my car to me. Every promise made was kept. The best part.... Glenn's awesome sense of humour, he is such a hoot! I am so grateful I chose Pukekohe Toyota!” Felicity Buche Hybrid Happy \"It goes for almost 1000 kms\" Walter was in the market for a new vehicle that would cut his total petrol costs and achieve better mileage. “We saw the RAV4 was available in Hybrid and went straight for it. It not only allowed us to save money but also reduce our emissions on the environment”. Walter and his partner are such fans of the Hybrid RAV4, that they both had to get one. “We’re really happy with it. It’s very quiet, looks really cool and the fuel consumption is great - it goes for almost 1000 kms.” Walter Quan \"...best purchase … ever\" Jay bought a Toyota Hybrid for one key reason; he wanted a vehicle that would provide him with excellent fuel consumption in both urban and highway driving. The standout choice was the Prius Prime which has the added capability of plug-in charging. “The versatility of a Hybrid is great. I can make full use of the EV mode for my daily commutes and if I need to go long distances, I also have the reassurance of its smooth and efficient petrol engine. The amount of tech packed into the Prius was what ultimately won his heart, especially the impressive JBL sound system. \"The Prius also has truly unique and striking styling and turns heads everywhere I go. I love it, it’s the best purchase I’ve ever made.” Jay Herewini Toyota Eco Driving and Fuel Saving Tips Our busy lives mean we spend a lot of time travelling around in our cars.

The room was very comfortable, it is clear the host is very thoughtful about all the little details - there were snacks provided which was great as we had an early flight the next morning. The room was very clean and well-maintained. We could not have asked for a better stay our last night in New Zealand! It was also great that we could have a place to park our rental car for the night. Could not speak to the location, as our stay coincided with the Easter weekend so everything was closed. But it looked like it was very convenient based on the number of restaurants and shops we walked by. Nothing, everything was great!

Emerging from the rubble of the Christchurch earthquakes, this once-temporary boozer has become a permanent part of the city’s drinking culture. It’s a courtyard bar where the beer is cold and sold in real pints while the burgers are hot and cooked fresh. Thursday night is motorbike night and if you look carefully you might see Greg working on a motorbike. On the weekend the DJs spin vinyl from the workshop container. Pub dog Graham is on site four days a week. Graham says: “Dogs are welcome.” On a Friday afternoon in summer, we reckon this place is about as good as it gets in this ol’ town.

Just 50 metres from the camp is the estuary, which is ideal for safe boating, windsurfing, water-skiing, canoeing, fishing etc. Across the estuary is a sandspit partly covered in a pine plantation. A footbridge across the estuary boasts a reputation as being the longest in New Zealand. Within easy walking distance of the camp is beautiful Motutara Point with its many rocky coves. A trek south along the coast takes you to the Capitaine Bouganville Memorial. Following the coast road north will take you to many beautiful beaches, some sandy, some surf, others shingle. Ideal for coastal sea kayaking, sailing, fishing, snorkel or scuba diving, surfing, swimming, or just lying on the beach away from the crowds.

Would definitely recommend. The host Mimi was fabulous. Super helpful and attentive. She put on a lovely breakfast with croissants, rolls, cheeses and meats and had an espresso machine for the coffee hit in the morning. The bed was comfy and bathroom clean and tidy. The only thing that would have been a bonus was if there was a TV in the main bedroom. Because when you book you have the 2 bedrooms and bathroom to yourself, everything else is communal with the host. So a TV in the room would be good so you can relax on your own.

But nothing quite prepared me for how deeply ingrained gambling is in Aussie culture. It’s not just about flashy casinos—pokies (that’s what they call slot machines here) are everywhere. Bars, pubs, even small-town hotels all have their own little gaming corners. And while playing a few spins over a beer is part of the social scene, the real action, as I quickly learned, has moved online. After hearing from locals that online casinos are where the best bonuses and biggest wins happen, I decided to put my risk-assessment skills to the test in a new arena. On a quiet evening in my hotel, I set aside a $1500 budget and logged into some of the most recommended real money online casinos in Australia. What followed was an eye-opening experience—both in terms of gameplay and financial strategy. Some platforms offered huge welcome bonuses, while others impressed me with instant PayID withdrawals (a major plus for any investor who values liquidity). And let’s be honest, there’s a certain thrill in watching a multiplier climb in games like Aviator, much like tracking an asset in a high-volatility market. So, did I walk away with a profit, or did the house win? I’ll break down my experiences below—the best casinos, the most generous promotions, and where I found the smartest ways to play.

Coming home to rest, the Art Stable offers comfort and style with a rare inner city courtyard setting the building back from the street.

A beautiful sanctuary- right in the middle of the best that Wellington offers… Alison is a lovely host as well and has thought of everything to make our stay seamless. Highly recommended… Az Dec 2021 What an amazing stay! Alison is a wonderful host and the studio is setup for a perfect city weekend. The location couldn’t be more central with shopping, food, music and art at your doorstep. The studio has everything we needed and was super comfortable. The bed was delightfully comfy and the furnishings luxe! We already can’t wait to come back! Kat Nov 2021 \"Top rate apartment accommodation in a very central location. Cosy and warm, we had a very comfortable stay. Nice to have a well stocked place with plenty of towels, toilet paper and key pantry items which make all the difference to a stay. Everything is on your doorstep here. Highly recommended.\" Mel June 2021 \"A gem! Great location, very funky -it's an interesting place to stay, and we would happily stay again. We also loved how warm it was inside. The little touches were great (extra comfy bedding, dressing gowns, amazing art!)\" Melissa May 2021 \"Fantastic apartment, right in the centre of the city but also very secure with a locked gate, locked front door and locked apartment.

    "homepage_content":"Bay of Islands - Travel Brokers Skip to the content Close Menu Thanksgiving was one heck of a vacation. I flew in late Tuesday night with my girlfriend and tons of luggage. We arrived at Albany International Airport at 7:08 PM, breezed through security and hopped in an Uber. We rode to Price Chopper on Route 9 in Latham, NY, where we grabbed some quick snacks. Then, we sat down at JJ Rafferty’s Bar and Grill to have a quick dinner. Right after, we rented a scooter to drive to my parent’s house. That was a mistake! It’s too cold to be riding that right now. I could barely feel my hands with the wind whipping by. We were making a lane change near 847 New Loudon Rd and some guy in a Camaro cut us off. I slammed on the brakes and we flipped off the scooter and rolled off the side of the road. As we were falling, my girlfriend hit her face on the handlebar and broke her tooth. We didn’t have any other injuries, but that one didn’t look good. She was in a lot of pain, so I started searching for an emergency dentist in Latham. That’s when I came across www.lathamdentalpros.com . They were the only dentist office that offered emergency dental services around the clock, so I called them right away. The head dentist was able to see us at their office within 15 minutes of my call. After a quick mouth inspection, he informed my girlfriend that she would have to have her tooth extracted and would need to use an oral prosthesis going forward. The process to remove it was quick, although it looked like it still hurt, even with Novocain injections. Luckily, we have good insurance. Our dental co-pay was only $100 for a procedure like this. The denture creation wasn’t something that could be done right away, so we came back on Saturday to discuss that. Overall, it was a very interesting Thanksgiving weekend. I feel lucky that Latham Dental Pros answered the phone on Tuesday night, and I don’t think I’ll be renting any more of those scooters any time soon. My job requires me to travel a lot, so I fly all over the world. Let me tell you what I saw when I was in New York City this past month. I boarded the airplane and flew straight here non-stop with just two small bags and the clothes I wore. When I arrived in New York, NY, I rented a car and drove it to my hotel. Shortly after unpacking, I took a shower, got dressed, and went downstairs to the lobby in order to determine where I wanted to go for dinner. NYC has many famous restaurants, so it was a tough decision. I chose to eat at a franchise restaurant instead, PF Chang’s, because my friend John works there. The meal was great, and after the restaurant closed for the night, my friend invited me to walk into the kitchen area to see the restaurant hood cleaning process. It appeared to be very tedious work. A company called Queens Hood Cleaning had 2 technicians pressure washing the vent hood and kitchen equipment with water and special chemicals to sanitize it. After that, they installed a grease trap. Apparently, a grease trap is a device that collects grease from cooking and catches it in a special compartment to prevent a clog in the drains or piping that connects to the sink. John said that the Queens Hood Cleaning Pros are one of, if not the best NYC grease trap installation companies because they remove all the grease effectively, always perform quality work, and their pricing is low. Whether their handling grease trap installation for a restaurant or scrubbing hoods, they are always timely and affordable. It was very cool to see this work being performed in front of me because I’ve never experienced anything like this before. If I didn’t already have a job, I’d consider this industry. Tags Grease Trap Cleaning , Grease Trap Installation , New York City , NYC , Restaurants , United States Have you ever chosen a hotel simply because of the amenities? Think about what you do prior to planning a trip. You have a general idea of the kind of experience you want; you might have a list in your head, or maybe you went so far as to write it down. Whatever that list may be, you’re not going to book that hotel for you and your significant other unless it meets those requirements. Believe it or not, swimming pools are one of the main amenities people simply must have. And, as a pool builder, it’s important to study the designs and construction from the best pool companies you can find so you’re always at the top of your game. The most impressively designed swimming pools I have ever seen are in Sarasota, Florida, so what better place to go and learn. My pool construction company is only 7 guys, so it was pretty easy to book a trip to Sarasota and hang out for a few days to tour the sites and see some well-designed residential and commercial pools. The first pool builder we met with was Sarasota Pool Builders, a local company with an impressive history of high quality construction in Florida. Their contractors have built thousands of swimming pools across the region, varying in size from small oval shaped ones to huge water-park pools. Their team met us at the airport and took us out to lunch first at Yoder’s Restaurant & Amish Village located at 3434 Bahia Vista St, Sarasota, FL 34239. After lunch, we felt like relaxing a bit, so we drove to the Marie Selby Botanical Gardens, which can be found at the following address: 811 S Palm Ave , Sarasota, FL 34236-7726. It was very cool because it had a huge variety of tropical plants, epiphytes, a koi pond, a rainforest, and a nice view of the bay; that part felt just like home! We stayed at the botanical garden for about 2 hours before deciding to start our swimming pool tour. Sarasota Pool Builders paid for a limo to drive us around to view their previous work. Our first stop was Judy Anders, a local resident with a home on S Jefferson Ave. Judy had a wide-open backyard and decided to have a figure-8 shaped pool built just beyond the patio. The amount of detail was crazy. The shape and design were absolutely flawless, with a set of stairs on the northwest corner of the pool and a ladder at the southwest corner. The pool liner was a combination of blue and teal with a shell pattern that repeated in 4 foot chunks. Outside the pool, their contractors had even installed custom lighting for added ambiance. We’ve never seen anything quite like it. After leaving Judy’s residence, we traveled to the Suncoast Technical College – Newtown Campus area in North Sarasota. Jamie Parsons, a long-time resident lived next to the school and graciously offered us a tour of her backyard. This residential monstrosity was nothing like the previous one we had seen. I swear to you – the pool must have been 75 feet long and 30 feet across. It started at 3 feet deep up top and went down to 13 feet in the deep-end. The coolest part about the pool was a luminous liner though. The sun was going down when we arrived, and we got to see the swimming pool glow in the dark. This whole trip was made possible by my friend and the owner at Sarasota Pool Builders, so we want to say thank you for allowing us the opportunity to visit. We learned a lot and hope to take some of the creativity and design work back with us to apply in our own business.

This works out for your benefit because there is a pool that you can stay in the pool with your friends in. There are a lot of opportunities to go to the beach but there are more things that can go wrong. The pool can be a great secondary option in case the beach gets shut down or it wasn’t the experience that you thought it would be. It’s a great place to be in if you plan on being there for multiple weeks. There’s a restaurant and bar in case you plan on staying there for a while. The food and drinks are great, and you should really give it a try even if you plan on trying other foods. Your rooms will also have air conditioning. It can get really hot outside when you’re in the middle of the summer. Having Air conditioning helps to makes things a lot more bearable. The Retreat This is one of the best prices for a hotel that you will ever receive in this area. It’s a bit smaller than the other options that you will have, but that likely means that you will have more privacy for you and whoever you decide to bring with you. The rooms may not have that much that stands out to impress you, but that also means that you have more opportunities to set it up for yourself. The views that you get are genuinely breathtaking. Generally, a hotel is not where people have memories, but there are some sights that you can only get in a hotel. The is a spa for you and other to stay at. These are great places because not only are they relaxing. The staff has seen a lot of positive feedback of all the things that they have done for their guests. It’s one of the cleanest hotels that you will go to. After spending all that time out, a lot of people will just want to relax and not have to worry about stress. This hotel does one of the best jobs at alleviating that stress. Sanctuary Palms Sanctuary Palms is one of the best hotels if budget isn’t an issue for you. For one, it has a golf course, which can be very expensive to maintain. On top of that Golf courses are location specific, which is why there aren’t golf courses in Alaska or Antarctica. This should immediately put it on your priorities list if you are a player and had the need to constantly practice. The service is very incredible, the staff are incredibly friendly and offer a lot of support to all of their guests. You should have no problems with the staff. On top of that there are kitchens in some of the rooms if you like to cook food. There are a lot of foods that belong to a specific area. Buying them at the store and then cooking them in your hotel is an experience in yourself. To many, food is just chemical energy and nutrition, but to others cooking is an art form and the hotel included a kitchen in some of the rooms to respect that. You get a luxurious experience that you just wouldn’t get with other hotels. I couldn’t decide which hotel to stay at, so I tried a different one every day of the week. Things to do in the Bay of Islands Costal Kayaking Kayaking is a great sport that encourages people to get into the water and lets them take a adventure. You get to take others with you so it’s not just yourself, you have those memories and experiences with others. That also means that if someone gets hurt, you will have someone to get help for you. In this specific case Kayaking in the Bay of Islands also lets you see some of the most beautiful sights that Paihia has to offer. You can even go in teams and compete against each other. You will have guides that teach you a lot about the area. It suitable for most ages. As long as the person can play a sport, they are more than capable for kayaking. The guides are also full of energy and very helpful. The people who have been on the guides were surprised how much knowledge they had on the area and said some of their best time was spend there. It can even give you a workout, if you’re someone who needs to constantly be in peak physical condition. Visit Tapeka Point Beach The beach can always be a lot of fun regardless of what location you are in. What separates most beaches is how many people are at the particular location as well as the things that you can do at the location. This is one of the beaches where there aren’t going to be that many people at the location. That just means that you and your friends will mostly have the beach for yourself. This works out great if you are planning on playing any games or taking any fancy photos. In fact, the lighting can be incredible, so you owe it to yourself to take a few photos when you get the chance. The views are also amazing. The sights are something that you can only see in Paihia.

There are also some chairs if you and your significant other just want to relax together and just enjoy the sights of nature. The houses and hotels won’t be that far from the location so it’s a great option for everyone. Take the sea shuttle to the Bay of Islands The sea shuttle lets you see some great sights that you more than likely wouldn’t have seen otherwise. Some of the sights you may have seen in a photo if you went out of your way to see them, however, to get the full experience it is something that you need to see with your own two eyes. The staff are incredibly forgiving even if you happened to be a few minutes late, you can more than likely get there in time for the guide. The experience is a lot of fine and it will be one of the most fun experiences you have in New Zealand. The tour may take 2 and a half to 3 hours. It’s a great time and there are a lot of people that can go on the shuttle at once. When you go on this shuttle it allows you to feel like you are interacting with the adventure and these places are actually there for you to explore. It’s something that you allowed to be laid back in, not something that you have to prepare hours for. It’s a lot of fun for everyone, including the guide who is educating you about these locations, You are going to be more informed on these locations by the time you get off the shuttle. Check Out Action World Action World is one of the most fun places in New Zealand. There are tons of rides that people can get a kick out of. It serves as an amusement center for all kinds of people during the summer. To get the full experience, the best time to go is the summer because you will get to experience all of the rides. On top of that, some of the hotels are going to be close there. If you happen to be staying close to Action World, it is a experience that you need to go to when you visit Paihia. If you like water slides, this center has some of the longest water slides that you will ever ride. It’s almost like going to a state fair and seeing all the rides that you can have fun on. There are also a lot of mini games that you owe it to yourself to play. You should go to all of the rides, give them a chance, and have fun on your own. Waitangi golf course Golf can be one of the most relaxing sports regardless of your physique or experience. Regardless of who you are, golf is made to test your skill and not if you have a certain body type. You can compete with your friends to see who will win on the course. Part of what makes a golf course so enjoyable is going to those courses on a bright day with all of your equipment. Whether you’re traveling in a golf cart or just walking with your bag, those are what cement this sport as memorable. The options that you must use for clubs are almost endless. There are some genuinely breathtaking views that you should see at least once if you’re a golf player. It’s a course that the most casual of players can have fun with and a lot of work is put in maintaining this course. For golf, it is recommended that you play in the earlier hours of the morning, that’s not only when you’ll play the best, but is also when the outside will look the best. After a long trip in New Zealand, it’s time for a trip back to the United States. The US was my original home and I loved visiting New York, Florida, and some of the other areas where my friends still live. Tags New Zealand , Travel , Vacation",

Room was modern clean fresh and spacious. Very warm and comfortable. Facilities were excellent and spotless. Especially enjoyed the hot spa after doing the Wairere Falls Track (which I recommend) the kids enjoyed the pool and the playground. Perfect place for a family. Had everything you need from toiletries to coffee and tea. Great location not far from Hobbiton or Wairere Falls. Owners were friendly and welcoming. Thoroughly enjoyed our time here will def be back.\" Pun Uniamat NZ \"We originally planned to stay only 1 night, as part of a visit to Hobbiton, but after seeing the room, the kids begged to stay 2 nights, and that was no problem with us. What a great motel. Everything was perfect, from a great sized, modern room, to a super pool and even being able to dry the clothes on the clothesline. Matamata is a very nice town, and this motel is within walking distance to the stores\/cafes on main street. We had a very relaxing stay and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this motel to our friends.\" Trip Advisor Review Calgary View More Testimonials",

Since we have moved cities we’ve made it a tradition to ensure we always grab a meal here every visit, it’s that good. The staff are so lovely, and the food is epic. If you’re in town, and craving Turkish, this is the place. J C (Jonts) We just passed the cafe and was intrigue about Turkish cousine. Did not dissappoint. The place is cozy and quiet. Definitely the food tastes good and has big portions. NO gamey taste for the lamb👍🏻 Dina D explorer I've been to a lot of kebab places around Lower Hutt, and this place beats them all. Great price kebabs, generous portions, and they are juicy without getting soggy. The meat was grilled well, with good sized pieces and lots of crispy bits, and the kebab was wrapped so that you don't have to fight the tinfoil away before you can eat it. I also had the baklava, which at $8 is on the pricier side, but it was a good portion with plenty of syrup nuts and crunchy pastry. Today was my 3rd time here, and it will be my go-to kebab shop from now on. Alex Karl Food was delicious and hot. Took a wee while to get our food but was worth the wait. Service was great. The staff were really friendly Taryn Holmes When we passed the shop, the food smell was amazing, so we wanted to try! Today was my first visit and it was amazing!

    "homepage_content":"Grafton Oaks Fitness Retreat hotel - Health & Wellness Holidays Steel Mace Workout – Macebell Ladders September 18, 2024 This workout’s called mace ladders. Basically, a ladder workout is where you add one additional rep each time you go through the circuit or each time you go through the set. It’s 15 minutes continuous, try not to stop if you can. If you do need to stop, just take a rest, have a 60-second rest, grab a drink, have a quick breather, get your heart rate back down, and then continue on. As over time you get stronger and more skilled with these functional training movements, you say if you finish your first set at six minutes, next time you do this workout, try and finish it at seven minutes, and each time you finish the workout, you’re getting more and more done. You increase your time under tension each time as you get stronger, don’t worry if you can’t do the full 15 minutes. Just do as much as you can, take a quick breather, and then just continue off where you left off. There’s four exercises in total. We’re gonna do one rep of ten and two. We’re going to go each direction, one rep of Half Moon off each leg, two-handed mil each side with just one rep, and then last one, uppercut lunge again each side. We just do one rep of those four exercises, then when we go around again to start, we do two reps of ten and two, two reps of Half Moon, two reps of two and a meal, two reps of uppercut lunge. Then we go three reps of each, four reps, five reps, six reps, seven reps. We build up on the reps as we go through the workout. We’re gonna go for the exercises now. I want to start off with a ten and two. Feet are pointing forward, quads are on, glutes tight, hands and navel. Elbows are tin, shoulders down and back, down over the shoulder, watch it come around with the weight. We do our ten and twos. And then for now, we’re going to bring it down into that switch called position. I’m gonna throw it up and then catch it down on the other side, fold up, catch it down on the other side. just make sure your knees track the toes when you’re doing your lunges, your lateral lunge. And from here, we’re going to go two-handed mil. Rotate the thoracic, cast it out, forearm lock, 180. If I’m coming from my right, I’m going over my left shoulder, I’m going to switch grips. Cast it out to the right this time. If I’m coming from my left, I want to come over my right shoulder. And then last off, we’re going to finish with an uppercut lunge. We’re going to bring that hand down towards the side and then punch up with my right, step forward with my left. I’m going to throw it up, change sides and then if I punch up my left, I’m going to step forward with my right. You do one rep of each of those exercises, now go two reps, then three, then four, then five reps. get as high as you can in the 15 minutes. If you do get the 15 minutes in without stopping, say if you do, say, nine reps of each of those exercises, next time you do this workout, try and get ten. And then use that as kind of a challenge to really push yourself each time you do the workout to try and get more and more out each time. Alright guys, that’s it for today’s YouTube workout, hope you enjoyed, and I will see you in the next one. P.S. Want more mace workouts just like this?

Battle ropes are a great way to build core strength and work on your balance. If you plan on using them at home, make sure there’s enough space for the rope since it will need some room outside its anchor point when extended away from whatever is holding up one side or both ends! Battle ropes are a great way to build strength and flexibility. You can use them in the gym, at home or on any journey-they’re perfect for traveling! Keep this equipment brief with your workout routine though – make sure you’ve got plenty of room because when extended away from anchor point will take up some space too. In order perform battle rope exercises properly it’s crucial that there is enough space available around us so we don’t get restricted creatively due lack luster surroundings which may cause injury during activity. One tip is to get properly fitted anchor mount and battling rope storage hook , this will help you keep your workout space nice and tidy. How long should a battle rope workout be? Battle Rope is an intense workout that will make you work up a sweat. You’ll be able to do it anywhere because there are no special equipment required! A battle rope circuit consists of five or six different exercises with 30 second breaks between them so choose whichever ones sound best suited for your needs above all else, then get strength training wherever possible by doing this repeating 5-8 times per session depending on how often they occur during the days schedule. Do battle rope workouts at home work? Battle rope exercises are a great way to build muscular strength , increase cardio fitness and boost athletic performance. They’re high energy but low impact so you can do them kneeling, sitting or even laying down if need be! A battle rope workout at home can be done in the garden, the garage or even inside if you have enough space. Credit: Battle Rope Australia How do beginners use battle ropes? Battle ropes can be used in many different ways to help you achieve your goals. For example, if it’s goal is simply strength training then try doing exercises such as rows or pushups with the battle rope held above head level so that both hands have something attached at all times – this will allow for better balance and stability while working out! Battleropes exercises for beginner workouts can be done by regressing the core fundamental movements, if need be, grab the the rope closer to the anchor point to decrease the weight of the rope. Is it OK to do battle ropes everyday? This is a great way to get your sweat on and simultaneously work out those muscles. With no rules for how often you should do battle rope workouts, it all depends upon what fitness goal one has in mind – whether they’re looking toward weight loss or improved athletic ability! A few intense sessions per week could be enough if this person wants something less rigorous but still challenging every day of their life (like me). Benefits of Sandbag Training July 8, 2022",

    "homepage_content":"Sapphire Springs Holiday Park Enjoy the fantastic coastal views of Waihi Beach, Orokawa Bay, and the endless pacific ocean on the Orokawa Bay Walk. Traverse coastal headlands with giant pohutukawa, kauri, puriri, and nikau palm overhead, hearing the calls of native birds, and crashing waves into the sandy bay. Orokawa Bay is a secluded beach within the Orokawa Scenic Reserve. To help you make the most of your trip to Orokawa Bay, we’ve prepared a guide with all the important details and some handy tips.

Whether you're a family, a local, or an international visitor, Golden Springs Motel & Holiday Park and 1080Facts are committed to ensuring your getaway is filled with leisure, adventure, and the chance to win big. Where does the walk start? To start your walk, the entrance is right near the lifesaving club. When you’re planning your start time, make sure you check the high tide times, as a strong swell can cut off access to the track. How long is the walk to Orokawa Bay? The walk is on the shorter end, around 45-minute one way, including the climb up the coastal headland and descending through native bush to Orokawa bay. While it’s relatively easy\/moderate, the walk is relatively hilly so if you’re taking children allow a little more time. Make sure you account for time at Orokawa Bay, it’s common to picnic at the bay and take some time to enjoy the peaceful beach before heading back for the evening. What is there to do at Orokawa Bay? After the hilly walk to the bay, you’ll definitely want to kick your shoes off and relax. While there are no facilities or food, the beach has a lot to offer. It’s common to enjoy a picnic under the giant pohutukawas (You may find a rope swing or two). There is plenty of space, so find a comfy spot to lay down a towel or picnic mat to bask in the peaceful scenery and warm summer sun. Is it safe to swim at Orokawa Bay? Unfortunately, swimming is not recommended at Orokawa Bay because of the sudden drop of the sea floor and common occurrence of rip-tide currents. However you can always dip your toes in, but make sure you exercise caution and are aware of tidal movements and those around you (especially young children). While swimming is not recommended, at the north end of the bay you’ll find fishermen casting off the rocks. What should I bring on my walk to Orokawa Bay? To really enjoy your walk and time at the bay, it is important you come prepared. Keep in mind there are no toilets, drinking water, food or facilities during the hike or at the bay. In terms of basics, make sure you bring along plenty of water, sunscreen, a suncap, sturdy walking footwear, and some food. If you’re looking to picnic, pack a lightweight picnic mat and basket. If you plan on taking a dip, bring appropriate swimming gear and a towel. What walks are connected to Orokawa Bay? In fact, Orokawa Bay is a small part of a much larger 145-hectare scenic reserve with a number of other fantastic walks and tracks. One option once you finish your walk to Orokawa Bay is to continue northward to Homunga Bay. Another fantastic picturesque bay (and one of our favourites) it will take approximately another 90-minutes and requires decent fitness levels. Alternatively, head 40 minutes inland through long grass and stream to see the William Wright Falls. Note that the falls are best viewed after a period of rainfall, but the area and walk is scenic through out the year. To learn more about hiking from Orokawa Bay, click here A beautiful view awaits at the end. It can be hiked in 45 min (or jogged in 20). The bay is secluded (but probably not empty of people).

It can have a major impact on your event and would also create a good lasting impression on all the guests who have attended it. Although finding a venue might seem like a simple task, there are certain things that you need to keep in mind in order to ensure the success of your event. What you should keep in mind before choosing function venues in Brisbane Choosing a function venue takes some research on your part as well. The first thing that you need to choose is to make sure that you have an idea about the number of people who will be attending. Next, you need to make a decision about why you want to choose a specific place to hold the event. Whether you are interested in holding a small party or a wedding ceremony or a corporate event, all of these things will have an impact on the venue that you will choose. Keeping these things in mind is essential because not all venues are the same. Each of these functions requires a different kind of place to setup and to ensure that it is a success. For example, if you are planning on holding a corporate event, you would be better at holding it in a hotel conference room or an open area which would easily accommodate a large number of people.

The venue also needs to have ample parking space so that people are able to park vehicles without any difficulty. Nobody wants to be late for a program just because they could not find a parking space. There are certain managers who also offer valet parking and make sure that you are able to avail the facility to ensure the comfort of your guests. Have a detailed talk with the manager so that you can fix the menu and make choices according to your budget. If possible, make sure that you are able to visit the venue in person so that you can have an idea regarding its ambience and accessibility. Doing an ocular visit when you look for function venues in Brisbane for your event will also help you to know the capacity and the number of guests who would be accommodated into a single area. Make sure that you consider all of the above-mentioned factors when choosing a function venue in Brisbane.

However, before you decide on the accommodation to book, there are several things that you must consider. This is because you want to have an accommodation that will make the most out of your visit to Hervey Bay. The following are some of the factors to consider when you are selecting accommodations in Hervey Bay: The location You must consider the exact location where the accommodation you want to book is located. In case you have come for a trip with your family, you need to look for a place where you can access all the attractive sites that you need to tour. You should also research whether the accommodation is in a town or a rural area. Ensure that the accommodations you select in Hervey Bay are also near the roads and other social facilities that when you want to access them, you can do it with a lot of ease. You must also be aware of the route to take when you arrive in Hervey Bay so that you can get to the place you booked for accommodation. Mind about your budget Budget, in this case, means the total money you want to spend during your stay in Hervey Bay. When you are selecting the accommodation of your choice, you must also find out how much is charged for the services in the hotels and lodgings that will be accommodating you. Different accommodations charge their customers differently, and hence you must consider the amount of money that you want to spend. In case you have a lot of money, you can go for expensive and more luxurious accommodation, but in case your budget is a bit tight, avoid staying in the expensive accommodation. In case you are travelling to Hervey with your family or friends, you will need several rooms. To make sure that you have not spent beyond your budget, think of booking one room that is big enough to accommodate more people rather than booking rooms for every one of you which can be more expensive. The facilities and amenities that are available in the accommodations Who wants to stay in a place where there are just a bed and a bathtub? No one can. Before you select an accommodation place for you, you must put in mind the types of amenities and facilities that are provided there. You should avoid booking accommodation that has very annoying amenities and facilities, yet they will charge you for spending your night or evening there. If you are travelling with your family, you need to select an accommodation that has very spacious rooms, a playground for your kids to play, a hotel or a bar for you to take your meals and drinks, bedrooms, swimming pools, or even a kitchen where you can cook for yourself. If you have the right amount of cash to spend, you can also find out whether the accommodation offers laundry services and also clean toiletries. Ensure that when you are selecting an accommodation, you have thoroughly researched the facilities and accommodations that are available. How many people are travelling with you For you to choose accommodation, you must have the total number of people who are accompanying you to Hervey Bay or even any area around and need accommodation. This will help you to know the number of rooms you are required to book. You should select an accommodation that allows people to share rooms so that you can save on the cost August 5, 2019 November 28, 2019 Leave a comment Choosing а wedding vеnuе іѕ nоt аn еаѕу јоb tо dо.

April 17, 2019 August 31, 2021 Leave a comment Almost everyone who works in restaurants will wish to have one in the future. Everyone dreams of owning a successful restaurant. Therefore, it is essential to learn how you can open an award-winning restaurant as discussed below. Start with the big three You need to start a restaurant with a great chef, a great location and a great concept. All this work together such that your location and chef fits your concept. Otherwise, you will not have an award-winning restaurant business. Accessibility to the restaurant is everything. You should make your restaurant accessible in terms of location, the brand and price point. This will familiarise your restaurant and attract many guests hence resulting in a booming, and one of the best restaurants in Hervey Bay. Spend much money on guests’ experience You need to spend money to add value to your guests. You should never go cheap on the equipment, valets and even desserts. Guests will always develop interests on the things they touch. You need to use some percentage of your revenue to make improvements that will give your guests a new experience. You may also decide to give gift cards or send many complimentary dishes to the tables. Guests will love to try using them especially when you recommend them to use because it creates a real connection will make the experience personal. Spending money on people already in the restaurant will help generate a positive feeling and positive word of mouth. Focus on organisation and systems of operation This will help you avoid making the biggest mistakes in your restaurant. You need to come off as corporate for you to sell out and become a chain. Chain restaurants usually thrive because they are individual restaurants with a great chef, great concept and a great location. They also develop systems that enable them to build their guest demand, hold on to key people and make enough money. An Organisation will help you to keep the flow of creativity. Putting outstanding systems gives you the freedom to be creative. Always overestimate the capital needs You need to have a plan for many months of working capital from the beginning. Thus, you may not have worries over the increased expenditure, and the time it takes to get regular customers. Capital is critical in opening new initial excitements for grab holding the customers. You will determine the success of the restaurant years later after opening it. Evolution is necessary when you are a chef Often you will have ideas for the products and services you offer, and they will become useful when you partner with someone with a complementary ability. For instance, you may partner with someone who will help you sell some of your services. If you are a chef, you can teach and delegate duties to others which will help you in running the business effectively. Always get people who are smarter than you so that you get to know new things. Learn to embrace teaching You may teach people from different places or interns from culinary schools to work in every station in your restaurant. They will then help you in shaping your menu to suit the guests. As a result, you will make a lot of profits. You have read above on how you can open an award-winning restaurant. If you focus on it, you will have the most successful restaurant business that many entrepreneurs will want to emulate. December 10, 2018 November 28, 2019 Leave a comment The next thing to do after landing into an airport is to find the best way of transport to the desired hotel within the town. It is true that most of us always go for a rental car as the first choice. However, for a great airport transfer experience in Wollongong, a limousine service becomes one of the most cost-effective and beneficial option to go for. Limousine hire in Wollongong is not such expensive as you may think. If you create a comparison with the cost, you incur after hiring a taxi to the desired location or trip, or if you compare with a rental car, you will realise that it’s cost effective to hire a limo to get you around instead. At Wollongong, a limousine will pick you from the airport, get you to the desired hotel or anywhere else you’re going and even back you to the airport at an affordable flat rate. It is true that when traveling, especially for the business people, you always want to get transferred to the intended location within the shortest time possible because of a tight schedule. As a result, it is always good to choose reliable professionals, the one who is in a position of transferring you to the intended location within the required timeline. Mostly, those involved in airport transfers in Wollongong offer transportation services like: Meeting and greeting services Assisting with luggage Meeting you at the gate After arriving in Wollongong airport, you will always find several airport transfers who are ready to transport you to the intended place within the schedule you provide. Therefore, there is no need of you to get worried whether you’ll be in a position of making to the next event before it starts or you need not to struggle to round up all the luggage. All this become hassle-free when you hire a limousine. Traffic patterns in Wollongong can be unpredictable, and hence you may not know the exact time to go. But, with a limousine service in Wollongong, you will be in a position of getting around within the time frame, and therefore, you need not worry about the issue of becoming late. An interesting thing when you hire a limousine is that you’ll come across experienced drivers, well conversant about the patterns of traffic and the time when they expect traffic to be worse. Thus, the drivers can avoid this time and areas experiencing traffic within that time as one way of ensuring that you’re getting to the intended location within the required time. However, when hiring a limousine service in Wollongong, it is essential to understand the basic levels of quality that falls in every part of the ride. It is true that you may get tempted and decide to hire the newest limousine company which is in the process of advertising its services. The bad thing with these companies is that they may be offering huge discounts to lure you and end up a transferring you to the intended location when you’re late. But, the main purpose of hiring a limousine is to get quality, class, excellence, and comfort. Always go for the experienced limousine services as they are in a position of delivering you to the intended location within the shortest time possible.

Therefore, taking good care of it must be your top priority. You may have spent quite some time, that is, months or even years to locate that outrageous expensive sparkle. Also, being a permanent fixture on your hand, you may want to ensure that it retains its shiny and sparkly feature for the coming years. All this is possible by merely taking the following tips into practice: Purchase insurance Insurance plays a vital role in protecting any of your financial investment in the event of damage, loss, or any unexpected misfortunes. Therefore, it is quite essential to have your diamond engagement ring every five or ten years depending on the rising cost of precious metal and diamonds. Never remove the ring in public Yes. Handwashing is a common thing in a public restroom must you must always work towards resisting the temptation of removing the diamond engagement ring while lathering up. All this is because there are high chances of leaving it on the sink’s ledge or even drop the ring down which can lead to high risk. Keep it clean Always avoid cleaning the gems by the use of random cleaners while at home. Here, the best decision is to take the diamond engagement ring to a skilled jeweller in Sydney so that it gets properly cleaned under the required conditions. Never treat the ring using harsh chemicals Whenever touching or cleaning harsh chemicals, you should remove the diamond engagement ring. All this is because the cleaning agents and bleach are in a position of dulling the ring’s finish and in turn harm the porous coloured gemstones such as emeralds. Never put it through the needless tear and wear Diamond is categorised as one of the hardest natural materials in the world. However, this is not an indication that the ring cannot chip. In most cases, the diamond’s cut table can wear and tear. But there is an option of avoiding this by ensuring that the ring does not knock against other hard materials. Never touch the centre stone No more cases of wondering on how to take care of your diamond engagement ring. You need to avoid touching the centre stone at any given cost. The common thing with diamond and any other precious stone is that they attract body oil, dirt, and dust. Therefore, whenever taking off or putting on the ring, you should always try to grab on either side of the centre stone instead of directly grabbing the stone.

Tourists from different countries make a trip to Hervey Bay, either alone or in groups to see the magnificent humpback whales. From late July up to early November, tourists gather at Hervey Bay to watch the whales. Whale watching in Hervey Bay usually leaves tourists with unforgettable memories that last a lifetime. These tourists even have the opportunity to interact personally with the whales. The primary reason why Hervey Bay is the best spot in the world for whale watching is that the magnificent humpbacks do not just pass by on reaching the Fraser Coast waters, but they stop to relax and socialise in these waters before making a return journey to Antarctica. What To Expect From Tour Guides In Hervey Bay When planning to visit Hervey Bay for whale watching it is best to engage the services of the locals who have knowledge and experience. The commentary of a tour guide will ensure that a tourist has a satisfying experience. For example, a tourist may not be able to differentiate between a whale and a dolphin from a distance, but with the expert eye of a tour guide, a whale can easily be spotted. Some tour boats may even employ the services of a trained naturalist to offer educational guidance to passengers. It is also good to go with a professional tour guide who will put the comfort and safety of the passenger as a priority. It is best to take a whaleboat that has adequate crew members trained in first aid and proper rescue skills.

Free, unlimited Wi-Fi. Experience traditional New Zealand Hospitality at is finest. Steeped in history, Ohaeawai (historically called Taiamai) is situated at the junction of State Highways 1 & 12, on what is locally known as 'The Crossroads'. Just as in times past, this apparently sleepy Village is still a major stop for locals and visitors alike. Ohaeawai is very convenient to the Twin Coast Cycle Trail from Bay of Islands to the Hokianga. The 13km first stage of the cycleway from nearby Kaikohe to Okaihau opened in 2011. Still a dominant feature of the area today, the historic Ohaeawai Hotel is a favourite gathering place for locals, residents from nearby settlements and visitors alike. You will often find the friendly, well known characters of the area engaged in a good old fashioned chin wag, a game of pool , or maybe just contemplating the day. The Ohaeawai Community has a keen interest in sporting competition, fielding championship winning men's rugby. There are also 18 hole and 9 hole golf courses very close by, so it's not surprising that many Ohaeawai folk enjoy this pastime. Whether you're passing through or staying a while longer, Ohaeawai is interesting in the present day as well as in its history. Centrally situated on the intersection of State Highway One and Twelve, theÂ township of Ohaeawai makes an excellent base for exploring the Bay of Islands, Kerikeri, Pahia, Russell, Hokianga Harbour, Kaitaia, Whangarei and Cape Reinga. CAMPERVANS VERY WELCOME, and if you join us for a meal and drinks your Van can stay for FREE!!!! (some conditions apply) © 2007 - Ohaeawai Hotel. All rights reserved | site by Redan Online",

Its intense heat comes from a combination of both dried and fresh Thai chiles and copious amounts of black pepper. That heat is intensified by the fact that the curry contains no coconut milk, which tames the spiciness of other curries with its relatively high fat content and its delicate sweetness.

The breakfast was the icing on the cake! Sitting on a glorious sunny morning in front of 180 deg views with warm croissants, expresso coffee and cereal and fresh fruit, it was divine! And our hosts Penny and Ross were such warm and friendly people, they had thought of everything! The only slight negative was the bathroom was not an ensuite directly off the bedroom, but since we had the whole downstairs area( bedrooms\/ main bathroom and lounge) to ourselves it wasn’t an issue. New Zealand Serena 10,0 Bagus sekali Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Leigh Panorama B&B Fabulous B&B in a beautiful setting Beautiful home and garden, Penny and Ross are stunning hosts and really made us feel welcome. Immaculately clean property, little touches like the homemade treats, water and fruit in the bedroom were greatly appreciated. It was raining whilst we were there but they have a deck with great views that would be amazing on a sunny day. Very convenient to local beaches and the Sawmill Cafe. Everything was perfect. New Zealand Matthew 10,0 Bagus sekali Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Leigh Panorama B&B Exceptional Ross and Penny are beautiful, thoughtful people and hosts. This bnb is absolutely stunning, super homely, and the local area is simply awesome with lots to do, really. I attended a musical gig at the Sawmill and now have found the place to be every time I come back. Leigh Panorama - Highly Recommended. Thank you, Ross and Penny. New Zealand Titima 10,0 Bagus sekali Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Leigh Panorama B&B Fabulous ! Our lovely hosts were fabulous! Gorgeous little welcoming touches in our room from homemade treats, fruit, water and spring flowers from the garden. We slept well in our comfortable warm bed, I enjoyed the sundrenched lounge, books and Magazines. A lovely spread for breakfast in the morning. This Area is stunning, we took a short walk nearby to see the amazing coastal views. We also visited the Marine reserve a short drive away and took in a beautiful setting sun. Matakana Village with its neat shops and eateries just a handy 15minutes drive away. So much to do even in a 24hr period, we wish we could have stayed a few nights and explored for longer, but 1 night was also just perfect for a short getaway. If you enjoy a homely feel and friendly hosts, you can't go past this lovely accommodation.

Whether you’re seeking adventure or relaxation, we have the ideal getaway for you! We would love to host you soon Hosts Guy & Tesa Hosting short stays since 2016 Guest Reviews Tesa and Guy have hosted Shortstays since 2016 and have received hundreds of positive reviews. Our employees loved going back to Tesa & Guy’s house at the end of their day. They were sorry that the job finished early and they had to return to Auckland ! The hosts were very pleasant and had good communication. They had the Beach House ready early for our guys to shift in which was very welcoming. Rob – Sept 2024 Lovely spot near the beach with an access point in front of the house. Lots of space and had everything we needed for our stay for a few days. Beautiful spot and lots of space on the deck to enjoy a meal. Loved the outdoor bath for the little ones and adults alike. Great place to stay with families. Sarah - March 2023 We have just completed a 15 day stay, 9 of us with some of us from Perth and locally in Bell Block. Tesa and Guy were amazing to deal with. Great communication when we were in Perth and even more so when we arrived in NZ. The home was better than the photos, and there was so much space we didn’t feel like we were in each other’s space. The close proximity to the beach was special, watching the weather roll in and out, seeing Maunga Taranaki from the upstairs rooms. The beach was a great safe playground for my grandsons and the grass area good for rugby games and cricket. All the amenities in the house were enough for us to cook our own meals. Highly recommend! Sahz - November 2023 Book Apartment Tesa & Guy were very friendly and helpful. They provided a fantastic place to relax. They allowed us to arrive a bit earlier which was very much appreciated. Thank you Paul - Sept 2024 This was the perfect spot for our three night stay. The unit had lots of space, a large bedroom as well as a great sized kitchen, with lots of amenities. Very well presented and clean. Quiet location close to the beach and Waitara town. We would definitely want to stay again. Great place from which to visit a number of open gardens during the Taranaki garden festival. Jonathan - November 2021 We thoroughly enjoyed our family long weekend away at Tesa & Guy’s home. Peaceful location with stunning views of the ocean and really easy access down to the beach. The home was very well equipped and clean. We particularly enjoyed using the BBQ, the deck where we had our meals and lounged about, and the outdoor swing and outdoor bath. We think Tesa & Guy’s home was excellent value for money. They were also very prompt and detailed in their communications with us. We unreservedly recommend Tesa & Guy’s home – give it a go, you won’t be disappointed! Joshua - November 2023 Book Home",

    "homepage_content":"﻿ Tauharasunrise.com – Sunrise Lodge Tauharasunrise.com Sunrise Lodge The Oruanui Eruption 12 Jun 2021 With a scale of eight on the Volcanic Explosivity Index, the Oruanui Eruption is one of the most significant and most unforgettable volcanic eruptions in New Zealand's history. It generated about 100 cubic miles of pyroclastic deposits. And the caldera it caused is filled by Lake Taupo (in its modern-day situation). Cycling at the Great Lake Walkway or Lions Walk 6 May 2021 The Great Lake Walkway or Lions Walk is one of Lake Taupo's best sites. Built by the Lions Club (Taupo), it's a 6.2-mile cycle track and a shared walk. Regardless of skill level, cyclists and walkers can enjoy the stunning views it features. The Splendor of Huka Falls 31 Mar 2021 Within Lake Taupo is the exuberant Huka Falls. It features powerful rapids, viewing decks, and walking tracks, making its way into the heart of photographers. If you are actually an adrenaline junkie who wants a thrilling experience there, go ahead and join water rafting and other extreme boating activities. The Highlights of Lake Taupo Lake Taupo is known as the largest freshwater lake in the Australasia region and is renowned for its clarity, with visibility as far as 13 metres deep. Readers of this blog will enjoy learning about the different species of fish, native birds, and local crayfish . Fascinating articles will discuss its volcanic origins, the best places to fish, and what sports can be enjoyed here. Cyclists can read about the Great Lake Trail, and history buffs can discover invaluable information on the area's Maori Rock carvings. For a leisurely way to see the lake, a scenic cruise is a great option. © 2025 Tauharasunrise.com. All Rights Reserved. Designed By Colorlib",

And veg noodles for my daughter. Food was very tasty. Pocket friendly. ... Jack B 9 months ago Pretty good curry. Levin branch doesn't do spicy enough but the Paraparaumu one definitely does. ... Pete Sharpe 7 months ago Really good takeaway only food, at very reasonable prices. Good quantity and full of flavor. Currys have a good amount of meat as well...not just sauce and rice, like some others. Staff are friendly and helpful. Can order online or at the shop. ... Carlos Gellidon 10 months ago Out of all the Indian places I've eaten throughout Wellington this joint has the most bang for your buck. A lot of places have their curry lacking in meat, but not here! Not only that but the taste of the dishes was great in general. The butter lamb, biryani, and beef masala really stood out. If you stop by Paraparaumu, definitely check this place out. ...

Location The Waters is a luxurious boutique Bed & Breakfast dramatically set above the turquoise Tasman Bay in the heart of the Nelson Wine region on the South Island of New Zealand. This region and especially the Kina Peninsula where The Waters is located, is lucky to receive on average the most sunshine hours of the South Island and is called the ‚Provence of the Southern Hemisphere’. Vineyards and olive groves like the one at The Waters are conveying a mediterranean feeling. The Suites are slightly elevated and only a few meters from the beach, which guarantees fantastic views of the Abel Tasman National Park – easily accessed for hiking or more adventurous trips. Boutique Suites ARIA* ORIWA MOANA TAHUNA The three Suites ARIA*, ORIWA and MOANA Each of our three 40m2 Suites feature the same level of comfort and furnishings.

Luna brought us a breakfast plate each evening that was delicious. Fresh eggs, juice, bread and cheeses. Local beer in the refrigerator when we returned from the day’s adventures. Very special people indeed. The views from our unit were incredible. The Tasman Sea to the east and a beautiful pond out our bedroom balcony. Top notch B&B Highly recommend. Great way to end our kiwi journey.\" Nikki, NZ      Tripadvisor \"The Waters\" was a perfect getaway retreat for a weekend away.

    "homepage_content":"Online Casino Games NZ - The Best Casino Games Online The Best Online Casino Games in New Zealand 18, 2020 Play Online Casino Games in New Zealand What do you immediately think of when imagining a casino? Perhaps people in suits sat at tables playing games of roulette and blackjack. Of perhaps you think of old ladies sat at fruit machines in some Vegas club. So, where does your mind take you when you think of online gaming? Can you imagine playing online casino games? Does the dynamic somewhat shift because itâs not something you know of unless youâve done it? Playing online is certainly different from your more regular assumption of a casino. Here we explain how and why as we introduce you to all the best online casino games you can play in NZ â every one of them! Slot Machines NZ Slots are by far the most common game to be found inside an online casino, with more than 5,000 different ones available on the New Zealand market, your options wonât be lacking. Slot machines are popular, fun and easy to play and pick the right machine and you could be in line to win the biggest jackpot prize of any online casino game. The variant of the standard slot machine is the progressive jackpot slot. This is a multiple jackpot gaming variant that is linked to a global network of casinos, so players from all over the world fight for the same cash prizes. Blackjack NZ One of the more popular and well-known card games. Blackjack is played by many as it comes with simple rules of engagement. Land 21 or as close to without going over and you beat the dealer. The blackjack card game comes with a number of variants also, there is Atlantic City Blackjack, 21 Blackjack and Pontoon to name a few. The diversity of the game also comes across two different gaming platforms. Blackjack can be experienced as a virtual machine game, rather like a slot, or it can be played as a live casino game where you compete against the dealer using real casino equipment. Poker NZ Poker is one of the biggest card games ever and online you get to experience every form of it. There are many video poker games which are virtual variants of the standard game of poker. Video poker includes titles like Deuces Wild, Joker Poker, All American Poker and Jacks or Better. For standard poker games, you get to play live, classics like Casino Hold âEm and Caribbean Stud are popular variants of the game in the live casino domain. Playing live also leads players to the chance of some tournament action against other players online. Roulette NZ Roulette is your all-time classic casino table game. Roulette is known to come in three forms, European roulette, French roulette and American roulette. But as you will soon see, the game provides many other variants such as double ball roulette and even double wheel roulette. The gaming feature appears in both virtual format and inside of live casino platforms. Roulette is one of the easiest games to play and it also offers you the casinos largest number of ways to bet for a single win. It also provides players with the highest single odd win of 35 ⁄ 1 if you predict the correct winning number. Craps NZ Craps is an All-American classic. If you watched any Hollywood movie that delves into Vegas , then you will see craps being played, from the TV show Friends to the Martin Scorsese film Casino, craps takes the spotlight. Craps is one of only two games where dice are used to determine the winning result. Granted it is a complex game for first time players, but highly worth the time to learn. Craps mainly comes inside online casinos as a virtual game, this is mainly due to the action of the game where the player throws the dice. In a live format, this is not possible, so where the games do appear live, you are betting on the throws done by the dealer. Sic Bo NZ The next dice game is the niche title of Sic Bo. By being a mix of craps and roulette, sic bo gives you plenty of betting options and the complexities of chance the dice provide. The game is available as both a virtual machine and as a live gaming feature. In the live game, the dice are shaken in a cage to reveal the outcome. This game is very niche and is perhaps one of the rarest to find online, more so as a live game, but they do exist out there. Virtual machines are also low in number, so if you should find one, count yourself lucky that you get to experience one of the oldest games ever designed. Keno NZ If you want a bit of lottery gameplay from your casino, then keno provides one of the options which you can take part in. Now, there are virtual games of keno which are more widely available, there are, however, very rare live keno games that are found inside specialist casinos that tend to focus more on the lottery side of gameplay. Keno is like bingo but gives you more ways of betting and picking the numbers you want. Bingo NZ One of the most nostalgic and classic games of all time. If you have never played bingo, you simply have not lived! Bingo is a fantastic heart-racing game that takes the thrill factor up to 10. Easy to play and very rewarding as you have three attempts to win a prize from the game. Bingo is both a game that comes live and as a machine variation. There are also different types of bingo. Some games played with the traditional 90-ball, others include 80-ball or 75-ball bingo. Live bingo games are reserved in specialist rooms where you have other casino members and the jackpot you win are not linked to a big network, so prizes remain in-house! Scratch Cards NZ One of the more diverse games and perhaps the easiest game you will ever play, scratch cards are so simple. Reveal matching symbols to claim a win. The higher you buy your scratch card at, the bigger the returning prize will be. Scratch cards online have one huge benefit over their high street counterparts because jackpots are always replenished. When buying any other way, you have no idea if the main prize has already been taken. Sports Betting NZ Sports betting, believe it or not, this feature is bigger than all casino gaming activity put together. There is no bigger, better or more immersive experience than what you get from sports betting. This is the ultimate challenge to put your money where your mouth is. If you think you know your sport and love your team, this makes every game and match a 100x better. You will be able to access over 30 different sports worldwide, from these games, you will have live in-play betting, over 3,000 odds markets, accumulative betting, cashout options and live gaming stats. From football to tennis, motor racing to rugby, you will have every gaming fixture, event, tournament, cup, race, fight and battle to bet on. Gameshow NZ The newest online gaming feature is that of the Gameshow. Yes, found only in the live casino section, you can play new games that provide exciting ways of winning money from the casinos online that have been wider explained on this website: https:\/\/www.nzonlinecasino.co.nz\/ . The gameshow games include Deal or No Deal, Monopoly Live and the Dream Catcher. Try something wholly new and different and live out that gameshow dream weâve all had once or twice in our life when sat in front of the box. %!(EXTRA string=Facebook) %!(EXTRA string=Twitter) %!(EXTRA string=Google+)",

Location is fantastic! New Zealand Hoda 8,0 Very good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about 360o Views Jackspoint Very Good I like the location and the vibe of the property, however I was so confused if I could use the lounge areas upstairs or not... and the door was sometimes open and other times was locked. Overall though it was a cosy little studio. As per above. Australia Avi 10,0 Excellent Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about 360o Views Jackspoint Exceptional Everything .. host were really friendly and helped us get around Queenstown View was to die for China Zhaoming 8,0 Very good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about 360o Views Jackspoint Very Good beautiful house ,friendly house owner stay with house owner, feel a little uncomfortable Japan Eron 9,0 Very good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about 360o Views Jackspoint Awesome Great host and nice decor and cleanliness. Also glad for the toys for the kids brought during the rainy day. Would be nice to have curtain on the big window in the living \/ kitchen area for both privacy and to block out the sun. It got quite hot when we were there. No cooling device for the house. Would also be good to add some Kleenex or paper towels. United Kingdom Charlotte 7,0 Good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about 360o Views Jackspoint Nice stay overall Beautiful location with amazing views, lovely property with a keen focus on interior design, spa pool was a major positive. Staff were friendly, and rooms were extremely clean, with lovely fresh smelling towels provided. Under the impression spa pool was private, one per room but this is not the case. This was not too much of an issue though as it was free when I wanted to use it. Also my room was part of the main house and shared the main kitchen, felt more like AirBnB...again not too much of an issue but I was not expecting this, especially for the price I paid per night. There was no curtains or blind to the main bedroom window and it would be worth considering adding kettle and teas\/coffees for each room, as there was a fridge but no hot drink making facilities. Overall a good stay but missing a few of the luxuries. New Zealand Sarah 8,0 Very good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about 360o Views Jackspoint Wonderful thank you The view was my favourite thing The kitchen facility's weren't great, which is fine so long as that's clear when booking as you are quite far out of town.

Unit had everything we needed. Lovely big fridge\/freezer. Shower pressure and water temperature was great. Check-in was an eye-watering experience - it took a long time (30 minutes plus), Eftpos was down, they attempted to charge double the agreed rate and the two units we had requested to be together (and assured they would be) were on complete opposite ends of the complex, one upstairs and one downstairs. Room was not child-friendly with an unsecured glass top coffee table that moved when touched. Very tired building. New Zealand Jacqueline 7,0 Good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about BeachLife Apartments Good Location! Value for money! Not quite as clean as it could be. New Zealand Lorraine 5,0 Good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about BeachLife Apartments Fair I booked the room at the last minute, and received a phone call from the place within 10 minutes which was great. The room was very large which was great, but I felt the furnishings were sparce, would have benefited from some floor rugs maybe. But was pleasant enough. New Zealand Ryan 7,0 Good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about BeachLife Apartments Would stay again Nice and close to the beach Not enough towels, someone took the hdmi cable so we couldn’t watch tv New Zealand Low 6,0 Good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about BeachLife Apartments Beachlife I loved how the walk to the beach was just across the road. Cool playgrounds nearby and a cool destination. The pier is beautiful especially at night. An awesome tourist place. I loved that this place catered to our needs with heat pumps and electric blankets so was definitely warm. Some things were wear and tear but overall we were Greatful. Loved that there were cooking facilities but no oven. It was clean but a little worn. Although language barriers are there they are nice and respectful. The blankets were beautiful soft and cozy which was definitely an upside for our stay. Thank you again. I would have loved more knowledge about cleaning facilities as our stay was longer than a night with children so a vacuum or cleaning utilities would have been nice. I would have loved new towels daily but there were drying racks so we dried and reused our towels. Mopping and floors should be done daily or offered. English is not these people's first language so there were barriers in that area which was a little frustrating because we didn't know there were other facilities such as washing machines and probably other things we were unaware of. I didn't want to look around for anything. I wasn't able to see the BBQ area or garden but I did see there was an area available on the website but I wouldn't know where to look. A bit on the pricey side however I do have 4 children and 2 adults so $110 per person for 3 nights was ok. Wifi is not the greatest but is available. It also seems everyone showers during the day so hot water can be scarce at those times. The reception isnt always available but contact numbers are visible on the windows. The TV did not work and made our stay a little difficult as our children were abit unsettled at times mainly night times after our tiki touring it would have been nice to relax but I had to entertain them after a whole days activities. As a parent a TV would have been much appreciated. I'm unsure if you have to hire them or not. But there are tvs that are in the rooms. I didn't read the reviews until after our stay and this place is not the worst but it does need improvements for the price they offer. Australia Margaret 7,0 Good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about BeachLife Apartments Comfortable easy to get to The fact that issues we had were dealt with straightaway Communication was hard New Zealand Tasha 5,0 Good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about BeachLife Apartments Fair Close to everything The water went cold after 2 showers. Kettle wasn't working . No oven. Had to ask for new towels everyday. We stayed for 5 nights and had to ask for clean sheets. Poor communication. Not worth what we paid for. New Zealand Roxanne 6,0 Good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about BeachLife Apartments Pleasant The view of the beach and sunrise in the morning was beautiful It was cold with one extra blanket that smelt like mold, the internet didn't work, staff didn't really talk or explain anything (like getting access on the gate upon check in). Curtains old and broken. Just not what it was made out to be New Zealand Richmond 5,0 Good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about BeachLife Apartments Lovely spot have stayed several times and condition hasnt improved it was clean but not very comfort Easy to find . Good location Large room. Wifi available Tea coffee Good kitchen for basic cooking The bed was uncomfortable. The place is showing its age and needs quite a bit of maintenance. Heating unit could be better wasnt cold but not warm. New Zealand Brenda 5,0 Good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about BeachLife Apartments Can do with upgrades. The ocean view. The balcony was slippery and I fell and hurt my knee and my ankles. The apartment self looked better on the photos. But we've made it work for the 3 nights. The apartment can do with some upgrades. Australia Rajneel 7,0 Good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about BeachLife Apartments Good good location near the beach & value for money reception speaks 0 English. we booked for 5 people & hot water ran out after the third person. New Zealand Sue 5,0 Good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about BeachLife Apartments Fair the location Needs upgrade. everything is old and tired. Receptionist could not speak very good English New Zealand Fiona 5,0 Good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about BeachLife Apartments Passable for a quick nights sleep but wouldn't book again. Heaters were good. Rooms were musty and hadn't been used. Had to open all doors and windows. Very basic - needs upgrading New Zealand Tammie 6,0 Good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about BeachLife Apartments Pleasant Spacious Heating wasnt working fridge was off when we got there, window latches were broken, more towels and toilet paper New Zealand Kirsty 7,0 Good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about BeachLife Apartments a fun week, great location close to the beach excellent value broken cooker side but it all still worked fine. New Zealand Agnes 5,0 Good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about BeachLife Apartments Fair The location was great. I use to live in christchurch and always loved New Brighton The photos and description of what was online to what I got didn't match New Zealand Ian 5,0 Good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about BeachLife Apartments Fair Just in need of a renovation so much . Tired and mouldy in places . Brighton is coming back but still looks tatty . Hope both the area and hotel will be reborn New Zealand Abbie 7,0 Good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about BeachLife Apartments Good sized apartments in a handy location apartments we’re large with lots of room heat pump took a lot of fiddling with settings to get it to heat. Australia Paul 6,0 Good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about BeachLife Apartments Disappointing. Bad sound proofing to upstairs. Kitchen missing basic utensils Spacious apartment close to the beach Noisy neighbours in room above. Missing a few of the kitchen utensils New Zealand John 7,0 Good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about BeachLife Apartments Coastal location and close to shops. Comfortable beds in our two-bedroom apartment, a large stove and ceramic cook top. Two pots one frypan, cutlery, crockery, glasses and a refrigerator were provided. There was a glass-topped dining table with six chairs and a TV with half a dozen channels. Everything worked well and there was an excellent shower, clean towels replaced daily and rubbish bins emptied as soon as we asked. Softer mattress perhaps and a bedside table on each side of the double bed.

United Kingdom Diana 8,0 Sangat bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Auckland Takapuna B&B Cathy and Sean were good hosts. As someone else mentioned, they are friendly and helpful without being too much. We enjoyed playing with the dog too! The house was located near the beach and as we had returned our hire car had easy access to buses. Help yourself breakfast was fine. Being near everything unfortunately meant there was some traffic noise as the main road was close by. China Laura 10,0 Bagus sekali Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Auckland Takapuna B&B It is absolutely great location to stay, close to beach, bus stop, shops and plenty of restaurants. The room and whole house are very clean. Breakfast is just everything we need. Non New Zealand NZ_Drea 9,0 Sangat bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Auckland Takapuna B&B The owners were absolutely lovely. Gave me a tour of the house and gave me the wifi password, along with an extra key. The house is beautiful, hard wood floors, tall cielings and quite open. They have a super friendly dog and cat. The room also had a cieling fan wich was incredibly convenient given how hot it was at the time. I think $160 for a night is quite expensive. The weather at the time was swelteringly hot. It felt like they had a winter duvet and flannel sheets on the bed. Australia Sharon 5,0 Bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Auckland Takapuna B&B No television either in room or working in lounge area - did have DVD's. Bathroom separate from the room. No signage outside to identify it. Sean was very pleasant and tried hard to rectify the situation Germany Carsten 9,0 Sangat bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Auckland Takapuna B&B The hosts make you feel very welcomed and are very courteous. The room, kitchen, bathroom are clean. The supermarket and the beach are not far - we enjoyed our stay! Thank you We could not find something we dont like :) Netherlands Ruud 9,0 Sangat bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Auckland Takapuna B&B Nice location in a quite area of Auckland with a beautiful beach. We liked to ride the mountainbikes we were allowed to borrow from the owner of the B&B. Also really good WiFi. Thanks ;-) Nothing, was a nice start of the vacation. New Zealand Anonymous 8,0 Sangat bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Auckland Takapuna B&B The character of the B & B was lovely and the accomodation was clean and close to the beach and shopping! The only thing that could have been better was the breakfast in the morning. A choice of two or three cereals and a couple of different unflavoured toast options would have been good with futher options for spreads. A mirror in the bedrooms would be helpful. Germany Heike 9,0 Sangat bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Auckland Takapuna B&B Generous size bedroom, very cute bathroom, uncluttered house with friendly but not in your face hosts, just right. Nice breakfast included and thank you for the yummy little welcome in the room :-) All you can expect from a B+B, very recommendable France Isabelle 6,0 Bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Auckland Takapuna B&B L’endroit et les propriétaires adorables. Ce n’est pas du tout un BandB! Une chambre chez des gens on a accès au frigo pour petit dej on fait notre vaisselle et notre lit. Ils doivent renommer leur location. Polynésie française Barbara 9,0 Sangat bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Auckland Takapuna B&B Un accueil aimable et adapté à nos demandes specifiques, des vélos enfant tout neufs mis à disposition, literie confortable, chambres et salle de bains bien chauffés pour saison froide, des petits chaussons offerts pour ne pas se geler les pieds (!), quartier calme avec commerces et plage à proximité, un petit déjeuner un peu plus complet que celui proposé ailleurs, et... Un gentil chien discret et affectueux :-). Merci Sean! Les chambres ont des stores vénitiens qui n'obscurcissent pas beaucoup, mais sinon que du positif.

The room was very comfortable and felt very secluded (couldn't hear much in the house). In terms of transport there are buses that run close by that take you into the city- I walked a couple of times and it only took an hour. (Rent a car if you want to do day trips). There was a bit of construction happening on the street so I guess it just depends how late\/how deep you sleep. Also they do have a dog but he is really cute and tiny and quiet!

Yes for the pay later option we normally charge guests on the day check in. But guest's credit card details is normally required for reservation to be confirmed. Many thanks! Any construction blocking the view at the moment? Any construction site near by? Because of Covid, do you offer free cancellation? Thank you! Not construction blocking the view anymore, and we have regained the lakeview a while ago. Sorry we don't offer free cancellation the moment instead we recommend that guest to have travel insurance if affected by Covid 19.

Access was easy. A learning curve for our hostess we felt, but she was very helpful. We would have liked the Tea\/coffee in the room. Somewhere to hang clothing in our room and the bathroom would have been useful. Also - in hindsight - paying for a breakfast that we cooked ourselves was probably not the best - but our hostess was preoccupied with an impending music festival rehearsal so is excusable I guess.

Kaikōura i-SITE Visitor Information Centre Kaikōura West End Shopping Centre Restaurants & Bars Tours and Trips Bus Stops Happy Guests Say... I stayed here for one night but wish I had more time. Helen is an excellent host - friendly, conversational, and helpful. She picked me up from the train station and brought be back the next day. I stayed in a 5-person dorm and the room was very clean and had enough space. The bathrooms were clean and the showers were hot. They are communal unisex bathrooms, but there is plenty of privacy. There is a hot tub on the deck that Helen will open up easily - it's a great way to relax after a day of exploring and chat with the other backpackers while enjoying a great view! In the evening she lit a fire for us to gather around and continue chatting, and the next day she stored my bags while I explored Kaikoura. I wish I could have stayed here longer! Great location and perfect for making friends STEPHL Blissful spot, beautiful grounds, staff lovely and so peaceful! Views from the garden were stunning. Wonderful ROBYN Very clean small hostel. Big shared rooms with windows. Whirlpool with a great view over Kaikoura and the landscape (the sea). Perfect Hostel MATHAIS Highly recommend this Hostel for Backpacker. Cheap accommodation, everything is super clean and staff is just friendly. Helen, the owner is willing to help you if you have questions. 1 minute away from town centre. Was a pleasure staying here! Nice, quite, clean, perfect view!” FREDDY Excellent location walking distance from the town and ample parking space. Great views and an outside hot tub. Along the coast we saw a very large number of seals and their pups. Excellent location Rebecca This place is simply amazing. The people here are really nice and kind and the whole place has a very family like atmosphere. You can see the mountains and the sea from the kitchen area, the view is amazing and I can recommend getting up to see the sunrise. It's a very clean hostel and the hot pool is super cosy. They also have an adorable cat. Of all the hostels I have been to this one will always hold a very special place in my hart <3 This place is simply amazing Isabella It is really well located. small backpackers which feel more like home than a hostel. a deck and backyard with an amazing view. a short walk uphill from the bus stop, really nice! It is really well located Irene Location is really great, two minute walking to the city centre. The view is awesome, you can see the sea from the kitchen - which is nice, has a reasonable size and you can find everything you need if you want to cook. Bathroom is also good with water pressure and hot water. Showers have a small area for you to hang your stuff and change clothes. The place is really very nice and you feel like home, very quiet, clean and well maintained. Very nice place to stay PELIPE Very cool and cosy backpack. Free wifi and all clean. 2 min walking from the bus station (inter city \/ naked bus). The garden is cute, like home. Top Top!!! VICTORIA Great location, so close to the esplanade in Kaikoura, yet far enough away to enjoy the peace and quiet and admire the views. The rooms are spacious and tidy and the kitchen and dinning (indoor and outdoor areas) are very well set out. The hostel is surrounded by pleasant gradens and even has a hot tub. The staff were pleasant and the cost was quite reasonable. Definitely worth a look if you are planning in staying in Kaikoura. Great location Hayden 5 By far the best place to stay in Kaikoura. Friendly hosts, clean and spacious rooms, reasonable prices, close to pubs and stores and the beach, and the view from the veranda and garden is simply breathtaking. And they come with an adorable hostel cat, Maui! I lived at Dolphin Lodge for several months while working in Kaikoura and I enjoyed every single day there. Truly your home away from home.

    "homepage_content":"Grafton Oaks Fitness Retreat hotel - Health & Wellness Holidays Steel Mace Workout – Macebell Ladders September 18, 2024 This workout’s called mace ladders. Basically, a ladder workout is where you add one additional rep each time you go through the circuit or each time you go through the set. It’s 15 minutes continuous, try not to stop if you can. If you do need to stop, just take a rest, have a 60-second rest, grab a drink, have a quick breather, get your heart rate back down, and then continue on. As over time you get stronger and more skilled with these functional training movements, you say if you finish your first set at six minutes, next time you do this workout, try and finish it at seven minutes, and each time you finish the workout, you’re getting more and more done. You increase your time under tension each time as you get stronger, don’t worry if you can’t do the full 15 minutes. Just do as much as you can, take a quick breather, and then just continue off where you left off. There’s four exercises in total. We’re gonna do one rep of ten and two. We’re going to go each direction, one rep of Half Moon off each leg, two-handed mil each side with just one rep, and then last one, uppercut lunge again each side. We just do one rep of those four exercises, then when we go around again to start, we do two reps of ten and two, two reps of Half Moon, two reps of two and a meal, two reps of uppercut lunge. Then we go three reps of each, four reps, five reps, six reps, seven reps. We build up on the reps as we go through the workout. We’re gonna go for the exercises now. I want to start off with a ten and two. Feet are pointing forward, quads are on, glutes tight, hands and navel. Elbows are tin, shoulders down and back, down over the shoulder, watch it come around with the weight. We do our ten and twos. And then for now, we’re going to bring it down into that switch called position. I’m gonna throw it up and then catch it down on the other side, fold up, catch it down on the other side. just make sure your knees track the toes when you’re doing your lunges, your lateral lunge. And from here, we’re going to go two-handed mil. Rotate the thoracic, cast it out, forearm lock, 180. If I’m coming from my right, I’m going over my left shoulder, I’m going to switch grips. Cast it out to the right this time. If I’m coming from my left, I want to come over my right shoulder. And then last off, we’re going to finish with an uppercut lunge. We’re going to bring that hand down towards the side and then punch up with my right, step forward with my left. I’m going to throw it up, change sides and then if I punch up my left, I’m going to step forward with my right. You do one rep of each of those exercises, now go two reps, then three, then four, then five reps. get as high as you can in the 15 minutes. If you do get the 15 minutes in without stopping, say if you do, say, nine reps of each of those exercises, next time you do this workout, try and get ten. And then use that as kind of a challenge to really push yourself each time you do the workout to try and get more and more out each time. Alright guys, that’s it for today’s YouTube workout, hope you enjoyed, and I will see you in the next one. P.S. Want more mace workouts just like this?

Battle ropes are a great way to build core strength and work on your balance. If you plan on using them at home, make sure there’s enough space for the rope since it will need some room outside its anchor point when extended away from whatever is holding up one side or both ends! Battle ropes are a great way to build strength and flexibility. You can use them in the gym, at home or on any journey-they’re perfect for traveling! Keep this equipment brief with your workout routine though – make sure you’ve got plenty of room because when extended away from anchor point will take up some space too. In order perform battle rope exercises properly it’s crucial that there is enough space available around us so we don’t get restricted creatively due lack luster surroundings which may cause injury during activity. One tip is to get properly fitted anchor mount and battling rope storage hook , this will help you keep your workout space nice and tidy. How long should a battle rope workout be? Battle Rope is an intense workout that will make you work up a sweat. You’ll be able to do it anywhere because there are no special equipment required! A battle rope circuit consists of five or six different exercises with 30 second breaks between them so choose whichever ones sound best suited for your needs above all else, then get strength training wherever possible by doing this repeating 5-8 times per session depending on how often they occur during the days schedule. Do battle rope workouts at home work? Battle rope exercises are a great way to build muscular strength , increase cardio fitness and boost athletic performance. They’re high energy but low impact so you can do them kneeling, sitting or even laying down if need be! A battle rope workout at home can be done in the garden, the garage or even inside if you have enough space. Credit: Battle Rope Australia How do beginners use battle ropes? Battle ropes can be used in many different ways to help you achieve your goals. For example, if it’s goal is simply strength training then try doing exercises such as rows or pushups with the battle rope held above head level so that both hands have something attached at all times – this will allow for better balance and stability while working out! Battleropes exercises for beginner workouts can be done by regressing the core fundamental movements, if need be, grab the the rope closer to the anchor point to decrease the weight of the rope. Is it OK to do battle ropes everyday? This is a great way to get your sweat on and simultaneously work out those muscles. With no rules for how often you should do battle rope workouts, it all depends upon what fitness goal one has in mind – whether they’re looking toward weight loss or improved athletic ability! A few intense sessions per week could be enough if this person wants something less rigorous but still challenging every day of their life (like me). Benefits of Sandbag Training July 8, 2022",

My first time visit here for a quick lunch, turns out a disappointing one. By looking at the posters on the wall, I had some expectations to my order. When it was served I was speechless because basically it's just some chopped roasted ducks soaking in a bowl red chilli oil, with a few veges, and that sells $25. If it's delicious I would totally feel okay because it's worth every penny you paid. Unfortunately, it's not the case. Well, I still finished all simply didn't want to waste my food since I already paid for it. But, there won't be a next time though. Eric Chou奧克蘭寶哥 Place: The ambience was lovely and it was clean (though I ate there during off-peak hours). Staff\/Counter\/Waitress: She is bubbly and helpful. She thought I don't know how to use chopsticks and so kind of her to offer me a fork. 🤣😛 Thanks miss! Food: I ordered 2 dishes, they are: 1. ND05 - Sour and spicy potato noodle (NZ$11.80) Not that bad, but not so good. Well, apart from the plum vinegar which gave the sour taste and the dried chilli with overflowing chilli oil on it that gives that spicy flavor, nothing much special with it even if there are minced pork and bean sprouts. 2. SF01 - Pork and Cabbage Fried Dumplings (NZ$14) I was surprised when I saw the dumplings as soon as it was served, the dough ends (wrapper) was light green and it smells pandan and definitely it was! Nice catch for that one but I don't think it goes really well with the filling and plum vinegar. There are 19 pieces but quite small compared to the usual and less filling inside thus what can you say with those 19 pieces, haha🤣. (PS: They just serve plum vinegar with it and when I asked for chilli and ginger, the staff said they do not have and she seemed puzzled why I will put ginger in it. Well, in my stay in Singapore, that's how they eat it and also my Chinese friends will nod to that too!) I didn't get to take photo of the dumplings because I actually forgot about it and awed with the colour. Debbie Reyes Very tasty mixure of Chinese foods. My favorites are the Chinese burger and the Chongqing xiao mian. They usually have Chinese TV shows on the TVs way too loud and if you don't speak good Chinese they tend to just take your order card and do it before you can verify some things you have ordered. As a result I have had the wrong thing more than once. David Lots of choices of Chinese food and beverages but unfortunately when I visited, there were also a lot of them marked temporary unavailable. The food did not disappoint though, good portion and very tasty. The menu is conveniently in both English and Chinese and there is a bell on each table when waiter attention is needed. Overall, the experience was pleasant and I’ll go back again to try more! Debby Wei PREV NEXT LOCATION × Average Customer Rating 3.8 I believe this is a Chinese dinner opening for some years.

THanks Tracy 100% real reviews of Mini Homestay Check the opinions of our clients New Zealand Mapu 8,0 Very good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about Mini Homestay Have recommended to other family members already. Short stay was relaxing and comfortable The maintenance of all common areas; kitchen\/bathroom were exceptional. Very satisfying to see the hygiene standards were excellent! Although a bit of a mix up with the room booking for first night, we felt secure with the extra security of having cameras in all main common areas - were able to leave room doors open when popping out for a few minutes. Felt safe When others 'stomped' around like herd of elephants - some people just are not aware of how heavy-footed they are, but this is to be expected given the amount of travelers that came through the mini-homestay while we were there Denmark Susanne 9,0 Very good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about Mini Homestay Wonderful Nice and cleen Place. The host was friendly and accommodating. Nothing. Canada Tracy 8,0 Very good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about Mini Homestay Very Good Very spacious bedrooms and kitchen.

Good WiFi and facilities I found it expensive United States of America Kathryn 8,0 Very good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about Mini Homestay Mini Homestay They let us check in early which was very helpful. It was a shared house which I didn't understand when I reserved it. It was fine but not my favorite way to travel. The owner and the other guests were nice. It was not the most expensive so we probably got what we paid for. The sunrooms was nice. There were kitchen facilities. We used the refrigerator but I didn't feel super comfortable cooking there. There were three bathroom all with showers that were very nice. I am not a fan of sharing living space with strangers. If that doesn't bother you the place was great. A but old and out dated export the bathrooms, they seemed new. They were very nice.

Friendly welcome, very clean and comfy. Free tea and coffee. If you don't have a car, it's really not close to any restaurant. There's a rather greasy take-away nearby and that's all.

    "homepage_content":"Caroline’s outback camping ground | The New Zealand Camping Guide This website requires JavaScript! Please enable JavaScript in your browser and reload the page! Caroline’s Outback Camping Ground Google Rating (out of 5): 4.4 Review Summary: Caroline’s Outback Camping Ground offers a serene getaway surrounded by stunning landscapes. Customers on platforms like Google Reviews and TripAdvisor have highlighted the peaceful atmosphere and well-maintained facilities. Many appreciate the friendly staff who provide helpful tips about local hikes and sights. The camping spots are spacious, allowing for a more private experience. On the downside, some visitors have noted that WiFi is limited, which can be a drawback for those wanting to stay connected. Others mentioned that road access could be tricky during wet conditions. Overall, Caroline\\'s provides a charming camping experience for nature lovers, though improvements in connectivity would enhance the stay. Last Update: 29\/04\/2025 Google Reviews Link: Google Reviews Link Address: 181 Somme Parade, Aramoho, , Whanganui, Manawatu, North Island DESCRIPTION: The camp is directly behind the Caroline's Boatshed Bar and E atery and TAB and beside the river and the railway line. The cluster of permanent living caravans and house buses, and the back yard bits and pieces around the place give the camp a lived-in, rather than a holiday feel. The ablutions and kitchen are basic. Bruce is the on-site manager.

Hearing well is integral to our well-being. It allows us to communicate with the people around us and connects us to our environment. Hearing loss can happen due to several factors, the most common of which is ageing and the other is exposure to loud noise. An untreated hearing loss may be detrimental to our health. It can lead to a sense of isolation and reduced social contact. It can significantly affect the quality of our life. Research also indicates that there is an association between hearing loss and dementia. When is it time to get your hearing tested?

    "homepage_content":"Piece a Cake skip to main | skip to sidebar Piece a Cake Monday, January 11, 2010 This cake was 3 different flavoured tiers, choc mud, caramel mud and vanilla. The two bottom layers had dark choc ganache underneath the RTR icing and the vanilla had white choc gananche. The finished effect was very elegant and the bride said it was beautiful. Posted by Piece a Cake at 1\/11\/2010 No comments: This gorgeous white choc mud cake was made for one of my best friends Julie for her 40th birthday. She is a big fan of yellow roses and so it was a perfect choice for her. I was really pleased with the outcome and so was she! Posted by Piece a Cake at 1\/11\/2010 No comments: Sunday, December 13, 2009 Poker cake This cake was made for a young guy that is into poker. His Mum brought me a B&W pic for a cake that she had goggled. I was pretty pleased with the outcome and had fun doing it. Hope the birthday boy enjoyed it!! Cheers Tracy Posted by Piece a Cake at 12\/13\/2009 No comments: Terry's 60th cake I love this cake and so did Terry's wife. The horse was on the invitations so I transferred it (took me 3 attempts to ice it!!) The red icing was from Sandra at KiwiCakes, Bakels brand, so I din't have to colour it which was a god-send! Always fun to do something a bit different Cheers Tracy Posted by Piece a Cake at 12\/13\/2009 No comments: Wednesday, December 9, 2009 I made this cake for a lovely young lady for her 21st, looked really pretty with some of the edible glitter sprinkled on the stars (bit hard to see in the pic) Thanks to Sandra from Kiwicakes I now seem to be back 'online' with making posts!! Busy busy with lots a cakes at the mo and counting down those days till Christmas. Cheers Tracy Posted by Piece a Cake at 12\/09\/2009 1 comment: Tuesday, November 10, 2009 Well last week was hectic with our birthday celebrations. The articles in Scene mag and The Leader were both great and have certainly brought lots of new faces through the doors which was great to see. We gave away lots of cake, coffee and gorgeous cookies to our lucky customers, and everyone was very appreciative. All my staff performed outstandingly and I was very proud of them. The week finished with me having 4 cakes to ice on Friday, WOW what a way to finish the week! I've been having fun with the cupcakes this week decorating them and using some of the fantastic edible glitter that I got from Kiwicakes, the colours are AMAZING! And the chocolate wrap that I'm now getting the hang of is very cool. There are so many 'toys' out there to buy if you are into cake decorating. Who needs clothes and shoes??? LOL Tracy Posted by Piece a Cake at 11\/10\/2009 No comments: Sunday, November 1, 2009 Our 1st Birthday I can't believe that we have been at the cafe for a year! It has gone so fast, filled with lots of highs (and some lows!). Posted by Piece a Cake at 11\/01\/2009 No comments: Older Posts Home Subscribe to: Comments (Atom) Followers About Me Piece a Cake Whangarei, Northland, New Zealand Hi my name is Tracy and along with my husband Neil, we own Piece a Cake, a Cafe and Cake Specialist store in Whangarei. I am a trained pastry chef having competed 2 years fulltime study at AUT in Auckland, coming top of my class both years! We opened the cafe in Oct 2008. My passion is good food (and wine) but I particularly love baking and decorating cakes. Ask those around me, I show my love through food! I love creating cakes for people and seeing their reaction when they come to pick it up. WOW!! is usually what they say, it gives me a great sense of satisfaction. Check out my photos of some of my work and don't hesitate to call into the Cafe or give me a call. Cheers Tracy View my complete profile Subscribe To Posts Atom Posts All Comments Atom All Comments",

The 'old English' style surroundings were great, with nice restaurants and shopping nearby. The house is situated above a very busy motorway-like road, which runs right between the marina area and the originally very beautiful and quiet housing area. Used to quiet surroundings we were not happy with the permanent noise, particularly at night. Australia Eric 10,0 Excellent Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about Million Dollar View Relaxation on a busy city Location Location Location. And the view. It was so relaxing. Just like a home. It was very hot in Auckland and the AirCon struggled to distribute cool air to the rest of the house.

Wasps on the balcony, so we couldn’t use it, and their sweet kitty Ruby was locked out of the house. There’s no mention of her in the description of the house and we were concerned about her safety. It was wonderful to have her inside with us!! However, I could see some guests being uncomfortable with allergies and keeping her outside in the cold. There was a cockroach in the fridge but we killed it.

An easy drive from airport, friendly hosts, quite location, spacious room & comfortable bed. Good value for money, indeed. New Zealand Anonymous 8,0 Very good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about Poolside Haven Approachable hosts. Very clean and comfortable room with lovely aspect. Reversing out of the driveway was not my favourite thing but wanted to park close to the house . Could have parked before the driveway, though. New Zealand Anonymous 10,0 Excellent Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about Poolside Haven Our stay was wonderful and exceeded our expectations. We loved the beautiful view of Auckland and the owner was lovely. We highly recommend Poolside Haven! United Kingdom Gael 8,0 Very good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about Poolside Haven Michelle was a very pleasant host. Room was large and bed was very comfortable. Nice view, day and night. All good. It would have been helpful to have had a light continental breakfast supplied as the property is in a residential area and not right next to breakfast places. I understand the problems with cooking facilities so not suggesting that - just a box of cereal and a toaster with a couple of pieces of bread would suffice. Or even a couple of bowls and plates so you could provide your own food but still eat something before leaving. New Zealand Sheryl 10,0 Excellent Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about Poolside Haven Michelle was very pleasant and accomodating. We required an extra roll away bed which was provided with a full mattress (not a thin one as is usual on a roll away bed) and made for a very comfortable stay. The area was very quiet and felt very safe. Indonesia Maria 6,0 Good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about Poolside Haven spacious room, cleanliness, moderate stay, value for money the room heater not enough to make us warm in the spacious room so we need to use many layers of blankets the pathway to the cabin is quite far at the backyard so will getting a lil bit hard to bring the luggage down to the room New Zealand Tim 10,0 Excellent Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about Poolside Haven Didn't find the tea bags and no socket beside the bed for iPhone to charge New Zealand Warwick 10,0 Excellent Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about Poolside Haven The space, comfy bed, heatpump, the hosts, one night booking Nothing to dislike New Zealand Holly 10,0 Excellent Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about Poolside Haven Bus stop and train were a quick walking distance from property. United Kingdom George 9,0 Very good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about Poolside Haven Good location for an easy drive to the airport for an early flight, but just a few minutes' walk from the station for a trip into the city.

We have stayed here before to attend concerts at Mt Smart and it is easy to drive to the venue from here. Great to stay here especially if you don’t want to stay in the CBD. Paul was a great host. One of the beds was a little too firm for our liking, but that’s a personal preference New Zealand Khrista 8,0 Very good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about Restawhile Host is very friendly, goes the extra mile to make sure guests are informed. Location is super convenient, close to the train station. Accommodation is modern, warm and fresh. Very clean and well presented. Didn't realise that there was no TV or cooking facilities, would have expected them when you are booking what amounts to a 3 bedroom house. Bed in the middle room was very uncomfortable. Germany David 7,0 Good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about Restawhile It was clean and nicely decorated. It had 3 bedrooms, good for a family. Very good value and was quiet. The car park was pretty tight. The location was ok but you need to drive to see sights or go to restaurants, there's nothing in walking distance that I saw. New Zealand Tunmbi 10,0 Excellent Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about Restawhile very comfortable clean and tidy with good location ideal for a family or group of people. The owner is friendly and takes care of you as his guest. I wish I could stay here each time I come to Auckland. New Zealand Anonymous 9,0 Very good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about Restawhile Excellent accommodation, very clean, beds were comfortable (with electric blanket :), all the basics provided (linen, tea, soaps, milk), great host who leaves you to it, free wifi. We had a very short stay but this was perfect for what we needed. Thanks New Zealand Carolyn 8,0 Very good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about Restawhile The place on the whole was very comfy, very welcoming There were four of us staying in a three bedroom unit and there was only enough hot water for two quick showers. The only downside of our stay. New Zealand Damon 5,0 Good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about Restawhile Owner was friendly, handy to where I had my course, good shower A little hard to find as on a shared drive with muilty choices of houses no signage only GPS Cord. Microwave didn't work, unit was a flat under owners house so lots and lots of noise from above, No TV, bathroom heater like the microwave just for show, could hear owner and family talking above so no sound proving ( probably why their no TV ) Australia Bronwyn 10,0 Excellent Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about Restawhile I liked everything. Restawhile is a house with 3 bedrooms. Two double beds and one king size single. One and a half bathrooms. The cleaniless is exceptional as are the hosts Tight parking space. Only park narrow or small cars in the space allocated New Zealand Andrew 9,0 Very good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about Restawhile Great location; very quiet spot yet only 5 minute walk to Avondale station allowing us an easy, hassle free trip into the city centre. Paul is a very friendly, welcoming host; very obliging, going beyond the call of duty helping us in the planning of some of our activities New Zealand Acushla 10,0 Excellent Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about Restawhile Lovely and clean with a lovely friendly owner. Suitable for my mother that has difficulty walking. We found it a bit difficult to find as it is behind houses. Needed to be better labeled.

There was nothing I didn't like New Zealand Yates 9,0 Very good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about Quality on Woodham Affordable, comfortable and homely. It's a room in this guys house. It feels like you're instantly his roommate, so it's very comfortable. He has a cupboard of food he shares with all visitors and he upgraded our room because the room we had booked - the people before us had extended their stay. That was very nice of him! Also, I've never seen a place so cheap before! great price! I honestly didn't care too much but this is his HOME. It's not a hotel suite that is made to be cleaned top to bottom and you're sharing the bathroom, dining room and kitchen with the other guests as well so you can't expect perfection. The only thing that bugged me was there was no toilet paper holder\/dispenser in the front bathroom and he had a long driveway that was easy to miss at night.

Tirau is a great place to stop as an alternative to the bigger towns. ​ Sandi January 2023 Excellent value for money Excellent value for money! On our way back to Auckland we found this true gem and we're sure to return here for a long weekend later this year. The room we had was beautifully appointed, very spacious and had access to a deck and the garden, it had an equally spacious bathroom and a private tea\/coffee station in the adjacent corridor. Lovely little touches like the bath salt, biscuits and chocolates as well as a sumptuous breakfast made us feel very well looked after. To us, this was a 5-star experience for a very reasonable price. Highly recommended ​ Lindy L March 2023 Many many thanks for the accommodation at Rose Lodge last week when we up for the Rowing. The Nikau Room with the attached lounge room was ideal, especially for our longer stay. And your Continental Breakfast was excellent as far as the Menu & Quantity was concerned. Needless to say that next time we need accommodation in the area, Rose Lodge will be the first place we shall call. And please feel free to use this letter as our recommendation.

M TL Really clean kitchen and it is run by husband (chef) and wife. I tried their 9th dish on the menu : 3 in 1 Mixed Chicken Fried Rice, Combination Chow Mein (Pork & Beef), Egg Foo Young . Perfectly cooked juicy and taste with good quantity of crunchy vegetables (carrot, onion, broccoli, cauliflower). The chef cooks simultaneously 3 dishes on 3 woks and he is an artist with precision the way he adds spice to food. The best part is food wasn't oily, taste, good quantity, generous amount of meat and even after eating more than half of the meal doesn't feel too heavy on the stomach as it is not oily. Great customer service. Will return back to try rest of the menu.

Friendly & warm host who went out of her way to make us feel welcomed! Loved it Such a warm and welcoming atmosphere. Kitchen facilities unavailable, room only - great for a couple as we entered as a family of four .. New Zealand Dawson 8,0 Very good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about Sea view guest house TOP STOP &STAY I really liked the special welcome from Melissa. Lovely lady. The view stunning. Would stay again & recommend to others. Privacy was respected.. A bit fussy.. cleanliness is a top priority.. ... For me not everyone.. United States of America Jonathan 9,0 Very good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about Sea view guest house Wonderful space, stay & host. Would recommend to anyone! There's so many things that we loved about this place. Melissa was communicative and welcoming. She wrote the sweetest little signs to welcome us. We loved the quaint room that was truly perfect for our tiny family. It had everything we needed and the location was ideal. Melissa is a one of a kind host and we would stay again! The ONLY reason we didn't give this place a 10 has absolutely NOTHING to do with the stay or with the host. We traveled with a two year old- and if you know anything about two year olds, they have their own agenda. Our little lamb struggled with the time change traveling from the States and was whiney during the nighttime hours. On the second night of our stay another family had checked in to the other space. We had returned home from a long day out and our son was crying- it wasn't too awfully late, but later in the night. Needless to say, the other family wasn't a fan of our son's crying and made it very apparent by stomping on the ground above us. SO while the space is private but shared with others, I will say that you can hear most things going on throughout the entire house. It never bothered us, and I totally understand no one wants to hear a crying baby- I mean we don't either and we are his parents LOL Italy Paula 9,0 Very good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about Sea view guest house Wonderful The room, while not new, had an oceanic decor that made it feel fresh and cosy. Breakfast was simple and satisfying. The pool and jacuzzi were both breathtaking, and the beds were exceptionally comfortable. My children had a wonderful time during our stay.

Australia Louise 10,0 Bagus sekali Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Seaviews Accommodation Relaxing stay in a beautifully decorated, warm room with a lovely view of the bay. This room was the ground floor of a house. The view was wonderful. There is a beach in the town, Tahunanui Beach, very nice to walk along. Half the beach is a dog beach, entertaining to watch all the dogs have fun. Have to drive to it, 16 min, 11km. Most of the route is 50kmh limit. The room was beautiful, so clean and lovely colours. Big ensuite and walk in robe. Outside there is a outdoor furniture in the garden. The hosts were very friendly and helpful. We arrived at 2pm-ish tired from a lot of travelling so we popped round the corner to the 4 Square supermarket and got sandwiches, chocolate bars and a bottle of wine and just stayed in the room admiring the view. Continental breakfast is available at an extra cost. Everything was wonderful Neuseeland Gitta 9,0 Sangat bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari Seaviews Accommodation „Entspannt und ruhig mit Blick aufs Meer Das Haus ist neu und sehr modern, wie auch die Einrichtung. Alles super sauber und bequem. Die Vermieter freundlich. Im Zimmer ist ein Schreibtisch, aber keine Sitzecke, die hat man auf der überdachten Terrasse. Den unteren Garten hat man für sich. Die Aussicht ist super, sogar vom Bett aus, dank der großen Fenstertüren. Begehbarer Schrank, großes Bad mit großer Duschkabine und u.a. Regendusche. Es ist sehr ruhig, aber mit dem Auto ist man in 5 Minuten im Zentrum oder man leiht sich bei den Vermietern ein Fahrrad, dann ist es eine schöne Tour. Man sollte einplanen zum Essen auszugehen oder kalt zu Essen - großer Kühlschrank jedoch keine Mikrowelle wie man es von anderen Unterkünften in Neuseeland kennt. Ich hätte mich in dem Zimmer mit heller Einrichtung und Teppichboden aber ohnehin nicht zu kochen getraut.

An amazing location - hope to venture back again soon. Our hosts were so friendly, helpful and very interesting to talk to. The 3 dogs are just so lovable too! Loved the location...we went to sleep with the sound of the waves! The beach was a short walk away - not many seem to know about it so it felt like it was all ours. Diamond Harbour was a short drive away so it was handy to the ferry to Lyttleton. We were very happy that the weather was warm as the bathroom was around the corner from our room so we had to step outside to get there - this would be a little unpleasant on a cold night. United Kingdom Peter 8,0 Very good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about Te Pohue Farm Stay Trails NZ rustic charm personified - Peter & Jacquie :) Staying with Sam and Pete was a delight.

Netherlands Michiel 8,0 Very good Purpose of trip: Leisure trip What would you highlight about Te Pohue Farm Stay Trails Beautiful place, very friendly hosts The place is stonishing.

You can make nice and challenging walks at their estate. They have lovely dogs who donot bother you if you donont want. I had every day a nice tasty farmmeal. The last 3 km the road to the farm is a narrow gravelroad. You better be an experienced driver. The lucky thing: the farm is so remote that in 3 days I had the road for me alone.

New Zealand Neill 7,0 Bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari The Riccarton Hotel Convenient location at a fair price for the offer. This hotel is well placed for a visit to the university (About 20-minute flat walk) or easy access to the city (walk or bus). The rooms are clean and have good space and reasonable services for the price. Maybe an additional blanket \/ warmer duvet for this time of year (not a fan of the electric blanket options provided - this is a personal preference!)

Could do with a tidy up in some areas. Handy location, comfortable enough. We have stayed here a couple of times in the past and found the room clean. This time we thought the room was dated, the bed cover had marks and one of the pillow cases was stained that looked as though it handed been cleaned. Cups left wet on the tray. New Zealand Debbie 8,0 Sangat bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari The Riccarton Hotel Very Good Location, warm, clean and quiet There was a tea towel but no dishwashing liquid or dish cloth.

United Kingdom Stephanie 7,0 Bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari The Riccarton Hotel Ok for a short stay. The room was clean and functional with all required facilities. Receptionist friendly and helpful. Convenient for Riccarton Road\/ city transport. It was a little noisy from other rooms and the parking lot. The bathroom was functional but a bit too basic and ugly. New Zealand Christina 8,0 Sangat bagus Tujuan perjalanan: Perjalanan rekreasi Apa yang akan Anda soroti dari The Riccarton Hotel Very Good Location would normally be great but unfortunately works blocking Riccarton road entrance to the street. Not the hotels fault though. Pleasant enough rooms though in need of renovation. Were fine for our requirements so no complaints. I did find it unusual that the only staff I saw in the office was a young boy ( early teens?).. He clearly knew the job though and was very pleasant.

Hopefully it was just a one-off as it tasted much better on a previous visit. Kim G Fine Malaysian cuisine. Didn't make a mistake choosing it. Food naturally tastes delicious. Not salty nor msg tasting. Even had a take away. Generous servings too. I would recommend and would come back. Service is fine.

    "homepage_content":"Gates of Olympus slot online 🎰 | Play Gates of Olympus demo — New Zealand Casino Play Gates of Olympus for real money Official site for New Zealand players Gates of Olympus We help New Zealand players resolve issues with online casinos and make sure your complaints are delivered directly to the game developers. On our platform, you can learn about the legality and safety of online gaming in New Zealand, and we feature only trusted and regulated operators. We’ve gathered casinos that support NZD currency and popular local payment methods such as POLi, Skrill, and credit cards for your convenience. You’ll also find exclusive promotions and updates from local casinos and from Pragmatic Play, giving Kiwi players early access to bonuses and events. Remember to play responsibly — Gates of Olympus is pure entertainment, not a way to make money. Play free Play for real money Author Edward Denham Update October 14, 2025 Content Content Gate of Olympus brings a 6×5 layout with “pay anywhere” wins: land eight or more matching symbols anywhere on the grid and the Tumble feature clears them, letting fresh symbols drop for consecutive hits in one paid spin. Multipliers can spark at any time from 2× up to 500×—and if several appear during a tumble sequence, their values add together before applying to the total win. Four or more scatters launch 15 Free Spins where every multiplier you collect builds a running total that applies across the feature, creating genuine step-change moments when the screen connects. For players in Aotearoa, the experience is tuned for convenience: leading NZ-facing casinos support NZD balances, quick registration, local payment options such as POLi, Skrill, and bank transfer, and responsive support aligned to New Zealand time zones. Our free demo mirrors the main game’s interface and maths, so you can explore pay-anywhere wins, tumbles, and Zeus’s thunderbolt multipliers with no deposit. Fairness sits at the core. Gate of Olympus operates under licensing frameworks recognised internationally (including MGA, UKGC, and Gibraltar), with outcomes produced by certified RNGs and a standard RTP of 96.50%. Operators cannot alter the game algorithm the logic runs on secure servers with audited configurations. For NZ players, data is encrypted and responsible-play tooling is readily accessible. What to expect in session: in typical play the base game produces frequent smaller connections via tumbles, with multipliers appearing periodically and the bigger spikes arriving when Free Spins are active and the global multiplier grows. Illustrative figures from our NZ guide suggest roughly one payout in about four spins, multipliers appearing about once every 8–10 spins, Free Spins about once in ~250 spins, and a long-odds ceiling of 5,000×. Treat these as averages over time rather than promises they reflect the high-volatility profile that makes Olympus a thrill when Zeus strikes. On desktop and mobile, the interface keeps the essentials within easy reach Spin, Autoplay, and bet controls are immediate, with clean readouts for stake, win, and balance. Animations stay crisp as symbols tumble and the screen brightens when multipliers land the audio swells during feature transitions without pulling focus during longer sessions. The demo preserves this flow exactly, making it a practical way to get comfortable before switching to real play. Interface Review The interface of the gates of olympus game embodies a sense of divine power balanced with clear usability. The layout draws inspiration from ancient Greek architecture — marble columns, glowing gemstones, and a radiant figure of Zeus overseeing the reels. Every visual element feels purposeful, maintaining a clean alignment between art direction and functional clarity. The control panel is streamlined for both desktop and mobile experiences. The Spin, Autoplay, and Bet adjustment buttons are positioned within immediate reach, eliminating unnecessary scrolling or searching. The responsiveness of the buttons gives a feeling of precision, with subtle lighting effects confirming each interaction. Players can read all vital information — current bet, total win, and balance — without crowding the lower section of the screen. Animations flow with natural rhythm, particularly when the tumbling symbols cascade after a win. Each movement is framed to enhance visual satisfaction rather than distract. The transitions between normal play and bonus rounds are smooth, aided by atmospheric lighting shifts and intensified sound cues that highlight Zeus’s interventions. The balance between vivid effects and user control prevents sensory overload while keeping engagement high. Elegant Greek-themed interface blending mythic power and modern design The upper section features Zeus prominently, holding thunderbolts ready to strike during random multipliers. This visual anchor reinforces the theme and offers players instant recognition of game states. The color palette — dominated by gold, sapphire, and royal purple — conveys grandeur while maintaining contrast for readability. Sound design complements the interface’s clarity. Each interaction, from pressing Spin to watching the symbols fall, is supported by short, impactful tones that match the visual energy of the experience. Music fades subtly during extended play sessions to keep focus on gameplay. In gates of olympus free play , the same visual and functional structure is maintained, allowing users to explore all features without the pressure of wagering. The intuitive interface remains identical to the main version, serving both new players learning mechanics and returning players refining strategies. Overall, the presentation aligns with Pragmatic Play’s philosophy — visually rich, logically structured, and built for smooth interaction across all devices. Every design choice emphasizes clarity and excitement, making each session feel as monumental as a storm from the gods themselves.

Trusted platforms for players from New Zealand Key Criteria for Winning Online Casinos in New Zealand Players seeking success in Gates of Olympus by Pragmatic Play often focus on five main factors that distinguish trusted and rewarding platforms. Each element contributes to a fair and enjoyable gaming experience, especially for New Zealand players who value reliability and entertainment quality. Key factors that define reliable online casinos 1. High RTP and Transparent Mechanics Winning platforms display clear information about return-to-player percentages and game volatility. Gate of Olympus offers an RTP of 96.50%, giving users confidence in predictable performance and statistical fairness. 2. Licensed and Verified Operators A secure casino must hold recognized licenses, often from the Malta Gaming Authority, UK Gambling Commission, or New Zealand–friendly regulators. Verified sites provide protection for deposits, winnings, and personal data. 3. Local Payment and Currency Options Top-performing casinos allow NZD deposits and withdrawals through trusted systems such as POLi, Skrill, or direct bank transfers. Fast processing and no hidden conversion fees make gaming more convenient. 4. Bonuses with Clear Terms A good casino provides welcome offers and transparent wagering conditions.

Mobile Compatibility and Support Winning casinos deliver flawless gameplay across desktop and mobile devices. Responsive customer service, including live chat for New Zealand time zones, strengthens trust and encourages consistent play. Rules and Gameplay When you play Gates of Olympus , the journey begins across a 6×5 grid filled with radiant gemstones and divine symbols watched over by Zeus himself. Instead of traditional paylines, the game uses a “pay anywhere” system — matching eight or more symbols anywhere on the screen results in a win. Once a winning combination lands, the Tumble feature activates, removing winning symbols and allowing new ones to fall, potentially creating consecutive wins within a single spin. Each spin carries the chance of triggering a multiplier symbol — glowing orbs held by Zeus — that can range from 2× to 500×. When multiple multipliers appear during a tumble sequence, their total value is added together before being applied to the overall win, creating the potential for powerful combinations. Understanding gameplay mechanics and rules Landing four or more scatter symbols, represented by Zeus’s golden crown, activates the Free Spins round. Players receive 15 free spins, and every multiplier collected during this feature is added to a global multiplier that remains active for all remaining spins. This accumulation mechanic brings escalating excitement as each win contributes to a growing total. For players exploring the demo Gates of Olympus version, all the same mechanics apply, offering an authentic experience without financial commitment. The demo mode is ideal for understanding game flow, symbol values, and the thrill of chaining tumbles before switching to real play. Main Advantages The design and mechanics of Gate of Olympus deliver a balance of excitement, fairness, and innovation. From its unique payout system to its visually powerful presentation, the game provides an engaging experience tailored to both new and experienced players in New Zealand. Below are four defining advantages that make this title stand out among Pragmatic Play’s portfolio and in leading online casinos offering a gatesofolympus no deposit bonus option. Advantage Description Pay Anywhere Mechanic Wins are formed by landing eight or more matching symbols anywhere on the reels, not limited by paylines. This structure gives each spin multiple ways to generate rewards and keeps gameplay dynamic. Multiplier Excitement Random multiplier orbs appear during any spin, carrying values from 2× to 500×. When several appear together, they combine into a total multiplier, amplifying the overall result in a single thrilling moment. Free Spins with Global Multiplier Landing four scatter symbols grants 15 free spins, during which every multiplier is added to a growing global value. This accumulation system creates strong potential for high-value wins over multiple rounds. Immersive Visual and Sound Design The imagery of Zeus, lightning, and gemstones blends with orchestral sound effects for a cinematic feel. The energy of every tumble and strike keeps players engaged through both real and demo play. Highlights of powerful features and visual depth Registration Process To begin playing gate of olympus pragmatic play , first visit your chosen online casino and open the Casino or Slots section. Use the search bar to confirm that the game is available in the catalogue. Once verified, click “Register” or “Sign Up.” You will be asked to enter your personal details such as full name, date of birth, residential address, and email. After confirming your email address, proceed to set a secure password and agree to the casino’s terms and conditions. Next, select your preferred currency — NZD is often supported for New Zealand players — and choose a payment method like credit card, POLi, Skrill, or bank transfer. Deposit the desired amount, taking note of any welcome bonuses linked to slot play. Once the account is funded, navigate to Gates-of-Olympus and begin your session. Seamless registration and deposit process for new players During gameplay, winnings accumulate in your player balance, which can be viewed in your account dashboard. When you are ready to withdraw, access the “Cashier” or “Withdraw” section. Choose the same payment method used for your deposit, specify the withdrawal amount, and confirm the transaction. Verification may be required before the first withdrawal — typically by uploading ID and proof of address. After approval, funds are processed within one to three business days depending on the payment provider. Following this process ensures a smooth and secure experience from registration to withdrawal while enjoying the power of Zeus in Gate of Olympus. Why You Need the Demo Version The demo version of Gates-of-Olympus serves as an essential part of the player experience, providing a way to explore the mechanics and excitement of the game without financial commitment. When you play Gates of Olympus free , you experience the same stunning graphics, sound design, and dynamic gameplay that define the full version. The purpose of the demo is not only entertainment but education — allowing players to test the pay-anywhere system, observe how the Tumble feature operates, and witness the thrill of multiplier symbols that can reach up to 500×. For New Zealand players, this mode offers a practical opportunity to understand pacing, volatility, and potential outcomes before wagering real money. It provides a genuine preview of how Zeus’s multipliers and free spin rounds function within actual gameplay conditions, building confidence and familiarity through real-time interaction. Problem? Fullscreen Play for real money Play free Play for real money with 200% bonus Top 3 casinos Another benefit of the demo version lies in its ability to help players develop strategy and comfort with the user interface. New users can explore betting options, spin speeds, and visual settings without pressure, while experienced players can refine their approach to symbol recognition and win patterns. The demo mode mirrors the same mathematics and return-to-player ratio as the paid version, giving it authentic predictive value. It also offers insight into how bonuses are triggered, including the anticipation of four scatter symbols that lead to the 15 Free Spins feature. For those accessing the game from New Zealand, the demo runs directly in-browser on both desktop and mobile, requiring no registration or deposit. This freedom allows uninterrupted exploration of the game’s rhythm, from cascading wins to the climactic lightning strikes of Zeus. In essence, the demo version is a training ground — a perfect environment to experience the full depth of Gates-of-Olympus before engaging in real play, preserving both excitement and responsible gaming balance. Basic Winning Odds Calculator The structure of gates of olympus slots revolves around transparent probability mechanics designed to balance unpredictability with fairness. Each spin on the 6×5 grid follows a mathematical model based on symbol frequency, tumble probability, and multiplier occurrence. The table below outlines the basic odds that influence gameplay outcomes. These values are illustrative averages based on standard volatility and RTP settings (96.50%) used across Pragmatic Play’s certified operators. Transparent odds and return-to-player values explained visually Game Element Approximate Odds \/ Description Base Spin Win Chance Around 1 in 4 spins results in a payout of any size, depending on symbol clustering and the Tumble feature continuing multiple rounds. Multiplier Appearance Multiplier orbs appear in approximately 1 out of every 8 to 10 spins during base play, carrying random values between 2× and 500×. Free Spins Activation (4+ Scatters) The likelihood of triggering the Free Spins feature is roughly 1 in 250 spins, influenced by symbol distribution and bet level. Average Return to Player (RTP) The long-term statistical return is 96.50%, which reflects balanced volatility and high win potential during extended play sessions. Max Win Probability (5,000× Bet) The theoretical chance of achieving the maximum payout is near 1 in 8 million spins, consistent with the high-volatility structure. Basic Strategies for Gates of Olympus Success in the gatesofolympus slot machine depends on timing, risk management, and familiarity with its unique pay-anywhere mechanic. The first strategy focuses on understanding the rhythm of tumbles and multipliers. Since consecutive wins can occur within a single spin, it’s often more effective to play longer sessions with moderate bets rather than short bursts with high stakes. This approach allows the mathematics of the game — particularly the 96.50% RTP and medium-to-high volatility — to balance over time. Observing the frequency of multiplier appearances helps players gauge whether the session is trending toward bonus potential. The second strategy involves preparation for the Free Spins round. The most rewarding moments in the gates of olympus slot happen when multipliers accumulate during free play. Activating the feature with four or more scatters can produce substantial returns if the global multiplier builds across several spins. Players often aim to sustain their balance in base play while waiting for this feature rather than chasing every minor win. Managing bankroll by setting clear betting ranges — such as starting at low values and gradually increasing after small wins — can extend gameplay and improve odds of hitting high-value sequences. Smart tactics to enhance winning consistency Lastly, practicing in demo mode before real wagering allows users to test symbol patterns, tumble cycles, and variance pacing. The design of Gate of Olympus rewards patience and awareness. Each spin carries both chance and opportunity, making strategic consistency the key to experiencing its full divine potential. Safety and Fairness The gates of olympus stake experience is built on certified fairness and international compliance standards. Developed by Pragmatic Play, the game operates under multiple recognized gaming licenses, including those issued by the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA), the United Kingdom Gambling Commission (UKGC), and the Government of Gibraltar. These authorities require rigorous testing and ongoing audits to confirm that all results in the game are generated by a certified Random Number Generator (RNG). This independent system guarantees that every spin outcome is entirely random and cannot be predicted, replicated, or altered by any external party. Certified fairness and verified random outcomes The standard Return to Player (RTP) rate for Gates of Olympus is 96.50% , reflecting a statistically verified long-term payout ratio that aligns with fair play expectations across regulated markets. All RTP data is publicly documented and verified during the licensing process, offering full transparency to players and regulators. Casinos hosting the game have no technical control over its algorithms, as all operational logic is stored and executed on Pragmatic Play’s secure servers. This structure prevents any modification or interference from casino operators, maintaining fairness across every platform where the title is offered. For players in New Zealand, safety is reinforced through encrypted data transmission, responsible gaming tools, and compliance with international privacy standards. Pragmatic Play’s licensing framework, combined with RNG certification, creates an environment of trust where every spin of Gate of Olympus is governed solely by chance and verified mathematics, not by external manipulation or bias. Advantages of Mobile Applications The mobile versions of Gates-of-Olympus deliver the same vibrant gameplay, divine visuals, and precise mechanics that define the original release. Every feature — from cascading tumbles to lightning-charged multipliers — is fully optimised for touch interaction. Players in New Zealand can enjoy smooth gameplay, responsive animations, and quick access to bonuses without compromising quality or speed. The mobile format maintains the 6×5 grid structure and identical RTP rate of 96.50%, ensuring fairness and consistency across all devices. Each version is tested to provide identical outcomes to desktop play, offering convenience for those who prefer to enjoy their sessions on the go.

Promo Codes and Bonus Systems for Gates of Olympus Each online casino may offer its own promotional structure related to slot Gates of Olympus , giving New Zealand players access to unique rewards and opportunities. Some casinos feature welcome packages that include free spins or deposit matches tied exclusively to this title, while others provide ongoing tournaments, loyalty points, or cashback systems that reward consistent play. Promo codes often change periodically and can be applied during registration or before a deposit, activating exclusive benefits designed for this specific game. These offers can vary in value and wagering requirements, meaning that one platform’s promotion may suit casual players, while another might appeal to those seeking extended playtime or higher bonus limits. Unlock exclusive rewards and bonus opportunities Before signing up or depositing funds, it’s essential to examine the details of each promotion carefully. Every casino outlines its terms — including minimum deposits, withdrawal limits, and the exact number of spins or percentage of match bonuses — on its promotional page. Understanding these terms in advance prevents misunderstandings and helps players choose the most suitable bonus system. Some bonuses are designed exclusively for Gates-of-Olympus, meaning the rewards can only be used within this specific game rather than across the entire casino catalogue. Reviewing these conditions allows players to make informed decisions, optimise their balance, and play within their preferred limits. Pragmatic Play encourages responsible participation by advising all users to read casino policies thoroughly before activating bonuses or making their first deposit. FAQ Can the game adjust its difficulty depending on how long I play? No, the game’s difficulty never changes based on session length or player behaviour. Gate of Olympus operates using a certified Random Number Generator (RNG), meaning every spin is independent. The system does not record past activity or adapt its odds. Whether you play for five minutes or several hours, each result follows the same statistical model defined by Pragmatic Play’s licensing standards. Why does the game sometimes produce long periods without big wins? This variation is a natural part of its medium-to-high volatility design. The structure of Gates-of-Olympus focuses on creating occasional large rewards rather than frequent small ones. These fluctuations are part of what makes the game thrilling, as each spin carries the potential for sudden, substantial results. Players are encouraged to manage their balance wisely and view gameplay as entertainment rather than guaranteed progression. Does my device affect my chances of winning? No. Whether playing on a mobile device, tablet, or desktop, the mathematical foundation of the game remains identical. Pragmatic Play’s software is server-based, so performance differences between devices only affect graphics or loading speed — never the actual outcome of spins. This system maintains fairness across all platforms and licensed casinos worldwide.

Specially a halal menu. Can accommodate different group sizes. Would be a nice place to hang around with friends and family. Food was superb and delicious and I visited second time as well. Beijing roast duck was amazing and I tried it for the first time. Dumplings tasted well. We tried out many dishes there and did not regret of ordering and tasting for the first time. Definitely recommend and worth visiting many times to taste the food since they consistently maintain the same level of quality. Shafwana Shafeek This restaurant has giving me a great curiosity and challenged me to have a lunch here: 1. Why someone named a restaurant a FORBIDDEN CITY? It's very COOL like a movie title, but it's not. 2. It have a neon sign when open, even in the afternoon. It's weird but interesting for me! 3. the interior was not very inviting but at the same time very authentic?? 4. And then.. Serving an authentic chinese peking duck as a recommended menu?? 5. Some of the so-called Halal food wasn't leave a good impressions but okay I give it a try. I came with my wife on her birthday because she's craving peking duck from a long time, and we growing curiosity in this restaurant together. We ordered Roasted duck and Corn soup. The soup arrived first. My impressions is positive. The flavour was balanced. When you put some soy sauce and chilli oil, it hits different!! It was very perfect because we eating when outside is rainy so it warm our mouth, head and body. The roasted pecking duck became our \"main course\", along with the rice. We are very overwhelmed with the flavour. It's juicy, delicious, crispy skin... We could never want anything more than this!! The last bite still feel it's was first bite.. What an experience. When we finished and wanna pay, I never expected this: they selling the chilli oil!! Chilli oil here is very mandatory and never skip this on every meals here. Forbidden City is a proof that your restaurant doesn't have to be a gimmicky interior and striking sign to be a good restaurant. The name itself, the food, is enough reason to you why you should stop here and go home with the stuffed stomach. Very recommended. Abdul Razzaq I found the balance of flavour in all the dishes too much on the sweet side for me and the orange beef lacked a crispy batter. Helen Joe If you’re looking for an authentic halal Chinese restaurant with great food, large servings and quick service, this is the place to be. Bookings are recommended as they do get filled up some nights. I’ve been to many Chinese restaurants and this sits well on top of my list and the food is always consistent and service is quick no matter how busy they are. Eugene T Anyone who asks for the best Peking duck in Wellington, this is where you come! They have the best chef from Beijing and you get so much meat! You can choose \"one way\", 2 ways (Peking duck with noodle stir fry) or 3 ways (duck bone soup) basically just use the rest of the duck and not wasting them. We got the 3 ways and the soup is nice and refreshing, noodles we could live without but it's fine. Bonus is their cold dish mung bean noodles is the best I've ever had and love their stir fried eggplant with mince stuffing.

Sessions take place both inside and outside the classroom with a trip to your local New World, PAK’nSAVE or Four Square supermarket to put learnings into practice in a real-world setting. Food for Thought makes for a unique and fun nutrition education experience.

Browse our range CLOSE Enquire now Flooring Curtains & Blinds Solar Own a Franchise Blog About Locations Contact Book now 0800 421 001 Book now I have been the owner\/operator of Harrisons Carpet Manawatu since January 2005, when I left the comforts of an Accountancy office here in Palmerston North to spread my wings and buy my own \"little\" business. I soon became so busy in my own \"little\" business that I had to buy another van and start employing staff. I eventually sold a portion of the area I owned to serve my customers' expectations better. I look after half of Palmerston North with the surrounding areas of Feilding, Bulls, Sanson, Marton, the northern Manawatu district, and across some Whanganui areas. I'm sure you would have seen my distinctive sign written van zooming around the district. Both my partner Chris and I are very involved in the community and enjoy a stroll around the Palmerston North golf course together whenever we can. I support our local golf club by sponsoring an annual golf tournament known as the Harrisons Carpet Open Day, a very popular event.I believe my strength is listening to what my customers want and trying my best to deliver to their expectations so they can be delighted with their experience dealing with Harrisons. Get in touch with us today for an appointment, and remember - we come to you! Book a free consultation General enquiry Testimonials Here's what the locals had to say... Mary Sammons Whanganui Thanks for assisting us to get our lovely carpet supplied and beautifully installed. Perfect finishing to our home. Great value, plenty of product choice and excellent service. Michelle Brock Palmerston North Great service, Kaye and her team are always a pleasure to have in my home. I highly recommend them all :) Kathy Hardy Whanganui Great people ie Kaye, to deal with. Very prompt with appt. and with quote. Large selection of carpets to choose from and reasonable prices. The boys eg. carpet layers prompt in arriving and getting on with the job in hand, also very good with the vacuum cleaner lol. Carpet laid superbly with no hipcups and great music. Would throughly recommend Harrison's, Kaye and the boys (men). Tracey Greig Palmerston North Easy process. Kaye was amazing. Listened to what we needed and gave great advice. I would recommend her to everyone. C. Ancell Whanganui Excellent customer service calling in on me to check up on how I was feeling after the installation. I remain as happy, deep into the night, as I was when I last saw you. No reminder required for payment on remainder due. I am very fastidious in making sure payment for services rendered is expedited quickly and efficiently. Thank you again for an excellent product and an excellent service. I will spread the word far and wide. Nice doing business with you Pieter and Eliza Botha Manawatu Kaye has been very helpful, knowledgeable and supportive. It was a pleasure doing business with her. Ann Manley Palmerston North Great meeting with Kaye with her valuable knowledge and advise with assisting us with choosing our carpet. Now thatâs itâs been installed it makes our home warm and cosy.",

Highly recommended Rita Huang this restaurant has legit Shanghainese home dishes. I've been there twice to taste hometown flavor. The air dried pork belly in the yanduxian soup was excellent, I lingered around the aftertaste after going back home. drinken fish fillet was very competitive to some restaurants in Shanghai. Standing out aroma of rice wine and tender fish fillets got a big attention. And drunken chicken was legit too. The braised pork belly I had last time was out of gate, this is actually a usual dish in most Chinese restaurant. However this place got the unique flavor of east China. Almost every Shanghainese signature dish I tried here can be scored 9-10 out of 10. Staff here were nice but usually crazy busy, so help yourself if you can.

Welcome to Whanganui. Located 196km from Wellington, the capital of New Zealand, Whanganui sits on the banks of the magnificent Whanganui River, surrounded by lush national park and the Tasman sea. Your hire car is the ticket you’ll need for an exciting exploration of this beautiful part of the world. There’s no place quite like Whanganui. Grab a car and explore this charming town with an abundance of history, art, culture and nature to be discovered. Have a blast at Kowhai Park, perfect for families and those that are young at heart. You’ll find one of the world’s most unique playgrounds here, where kids can climb through an octopus or slide down a dinosaur’s back. There’s a whole playground of quirky adventures to be had, a water maze, a miniature railway and lots more to explore. Virgina Lake is another must-see, come feed the ducks and wander the Winter Garden – perfect at any time of year despite the name. There’s playgrounds and a beautiful bird aviary to explore amongst the beautifully landscaped garden. In the evening the Higginbottom Fountain in the middle of the lake comes alive with a light show sure to delight all viewers. If you’re looking for a slower pace experience, jump aboard the Waimarie paddle steamer, which has been cruising the river since 1899. With a guided tour you’ll learn all about the paddle steamers of bygone eras while you take in the ever-changing views. Te Awa o Whanganui (The Whanganui River) is the longest navigable river in New Zealand and there’s lots of different ways to explore it, from luxury charters to intrepid kayaking trips and a high-speed jet boat for those who really love adrenaline. Get back into nature and enjoy the spectacular nature walks and hikes throughout the surrounding Whanganui National Park. Discover more about the fascinating Maori culture, an important element of the park experience, the lush forest, and uncover hidden gems, like the stunning Bridge To Nowhere. For panoramic views of the town, the stunning west coastline, the lush forest and surrounding snow-capped mountains, take the elevator up to the Durie Hill War Memorial Tower. Built in 1919, this underground elevator is unique to New Zealand and the southern hemisphere. Visit the St Pauls Memorial Church in Putiki, a spectacular building featuring mesmerising Maori tukutuku (weavings) and lattice designs that give us a little sample of the history of the region. The church spot dates back to 1842, but the church standing today was built in 1936. Of course if after all of that you’re in need of some rest, there’s also plenty of stunning beaches to explore – for fishing and surfing try South Beach, or for a lazy day on the sand the gentle waves of Kai Iwi Beach are perfection itself. If you’d rather a walk along windswept cliffs with stunning views, then Castlecliff will be the place to go – whatever you choose, spectacular views and a chance to forget your everyday worries is yours to enjoy here. Whanganui is surrounded by beautiful and intriguing places to explore in every direction. You can head towards Wellington and stop at Taranki on the way – its picture perfect mountain and glassy lake are sure to have you reaching for you camera. There are a number of amazing walks through this area suitable for all members of the family, or you can visit historic homesteads and immerse yourself in culture and fine dining. Your Whanganui adventure awaits, and our hire cars can get you there. Related Articles Make the Most of Whanganui Destination Guides See all articles",

The boutique, hip and chic. Breakfast, lunch and dinner. Open early. Open late. The menu's serious if you're hungry, hilarious if you're not. Mostly vegetarian. Vegan and gluten free friendly. The wines, dignified. The cocktails, knock out. The pastries...oh, you will eat pastries. The music's cool swing, and here's the thing--the people at the tables, they are talking to one another. They are smiling and laughing and being together. And sometimes they fall in love. Even if you're by yourself, you're not alone at Kopi. People are here to be not with their machines, but with each other. Imagine that. Now stop imagining and go.

But today was my lucky day, this restaurant is located in the old Glen Eden station building, so it is right next to the current Glen Eden train depot. Upon arrival, I was informed of lunch specials and once order decisions were made, you go to the counter, place your order and pay. Food come out quickly and was absolutely delicious and good portion size. Paired with a couple of refreshing iced drinks, made for a perfect lunch. Parking in central Glen Eden can be tricky, but if you get the chance to visit here, i recommend it. cheekybulls The best Malaysian-style fish fillet curry laksa I have ever had. My friend dines here often and he highly recommended I try their food, it was my first time. Our conversation was cut short once the food arrived, there was no time to talk but eat and enjoy every mouthful as my taste buds were having a party! Inside the cafe it's rather small and intimate, I counted 20 seats available inside, they have tables outside but it's too cold to be dining outdoors in autumn and winter is just around the corner. It wouldn't be ideal if you were after a space to have private and confidential conversations because nearby tables and customers can hear you. The staff are friendly, polite and helpful and I will be back for more curry laksa. Thank you for a delicious, mouth-watering experience. Zandea Lee I can’t believe I haven’t reviewed this Malaysian restaurant yet! It’s the only Malaysian spot in the area since I moved here, and it has never let me down. The staff is always kind, and the food is consistently delicious. I can’t pick a favorite dish, but I’ve had many Nasi Lemak and Seafood Curry Laksa—both are amazing! Dokyun Kim Generous portions ensure delightful satisfaction without breaking the bank. Meals are so substantial that they can easily last for two days.

Fortunately, we managed to get a table. There were probably only 3 to 4 staff so service was a little slow but not overly bad. They do have the usual Kiwi style breakfast and also the traditional style Vietnamese food and drinks. The Vietnamese coffee was great however it would be nice to serve with an extra side of hot water as the condensed milk might seem overly sweet for some. Food was tasty and generous portions which we ended up taking some home. There are 2 toilets available and I have to say that they are pretty clean. The only letdown were the flies. We are nearing winter and there were easily around 10 flies buzzing around, so I would expect summer to be much worse. This would be something that’s easily taken care of so would definitely be back for more meals. Eugene T Peaceful piano music was very relaxing. This place has quite an insane menu - they literally have everything. It’s got all the canteen type food pies, chips fried chicken burgers etc then it also has all day breakfasts and a sirloin steak, plus a full range of Vietnamese delights! Plus shakes and smoothies - something here for everyone - and at friendly prices. Great for a family lunch basically! Jules Longdin-Prisk Very clean, big portions with an affordable price, and friendly staff. Loved the iced matcha latte with whipped cream covered by matcha dust for $7.5, I recommended to leave for 5-10 mins to get to the iced cold temperature. Beef noodle soup is very good, generous portions for me and even my toddler to share. She slurped to the last drop. Kelly Clark Was there during quiet time not much client around. Choice is slots plus u can have up 10pax sitting if you are having family gatherings since they do have more food choices for rice , noodle or sandwich type. I had Vietnamese spicy noodles which were sort of expensive due to the portions is big and can be up to 2 pax sharing if u are a small eater. It call spicy but not spicy for me as . Cleaning I would say depends as some people save it very clean but unfortunately I was there when the table wasn't really clean and oily which I don't think it's a big if your purpose is to eat and go . I did not wait that long as I got my order in 10min and left in a hurry as well. Catherine Zeitouni Indulge in the finest iced mocha in town priced at $6.80, boasting a perfect balance of sweetness and unparalleled flavor! It’s the ideal kickstart to your day. The noodles come along with generous amount fresh herb. Plus, the service is exceptional and welcoming. The café might not catch your eye from the outside, but trust me, it’s got all the goods, from great food to awesome service.

Loved the iced matcha latte with whipped cream covered by matcha dust for $7.5, I recommended to leave for 5-10 mins to get to the iced cold temperature. Beef noodle soup is very good, generous portions for me and even my toddler to share. She slurped to the last drop. Kelly Clark Was there during quiet time not much client around. Choice is slots plus u can have up 10pax sitting if you are having family gatherings since they do have more food choices for rice , noodle or sandwich type. I had Vietnamese spicy noodles which were sort of expensive due to the portions is big and can be up to 2 pax sharing if u are a small eater. It call spicy but not spicy for me as . Cleaning I would say depends as some people save it very clean but unfortunately I was there when the table wasn't really clean and oily which I don't think it's a big if your purpose is to eat and go . I did not wait that long as I got my order in 10min and left in a hurry as well. Catherine Zeitouni Indulge in the finest iced mocha in town priced at $6.80, boasting a perfect balance of sweetness and unparalleled flavor! It’s the ideal kickstart to your day. The noodles come along with generous amount fresh herb. Plus, the service is exceptional and welcoming. The café might not catch your eye from the outside, but trust me, it’s got all the goods, from great food to awesome service. JoJo Sexton",

A smallish place tucked into the bottom floor of an apartment. Perfectly cooked traditionally madr food and HEAPS to choose from too. Some of the best I've had outside the mainland hometown. Ant Last I am so glad I believed the other reviews. Clearly prepared using fresh, high quality ingredients, and very tasty indeed. One of the best takeaway meals I have ever had. Mark Braggins The surroundings are austere, but the food is outstanding - if you are a meat eater (they also have a wide rage of vegetarian dishes) I would recommend the Brisket, it has a touch of aniseed, and would be my personal favourite if it wasn't for the Spicy Ribs, they make my jaw lock just thinking about them. The Orange Beef is good and the deep fried Squid is to die for. There wouldn't be a food establishment in Wellington or probably NZ where you can get great food and great service for $20 a dish. I recommend you go with a few friends, select a dish each and share - you won't be disappointed. Patrick Great chinese food cooked very well. No frills but great value 👍 Lloyd Spence One of the best Chinese restaurants here in Welly! All the food taste really good and feel like home. Reasonable price and decent portion. Quick service.

In 1930, he married Denise Damour whom he had met during his childhood. The “ lovers ”, the poet and his childhood sweetheart, were created by Peynet in Valence, inspired by a music kiosk known since then as the Peynet kiosk. Ruth Dorrit Yacoby (1950 - 2015) Ruth is an international artist, painter and poet who lives in the south of Israel near the Dead Sea at the edge of the Judean desert. Woman offering her soul Through the figure of woman Yacoby expressed her freedom and her ability to fly or to risk falling, to attain to new experiences of redemption in a new firmament, to free herself of burdensome impurity by baptism, by self-purification, by birth. The soul’s self-extrication from the material that surrounds it—the body: that is the sacrificial victim’s way of coming closer to God.

The highlight of the meal was the roast duck. The meat was incredibly tender, and the skin was perfectly crispy, just the right balance of flavor and texture. The staff were attentive, and made sure we had everything we needed throughout the meal. We didn't have to wait long for our food, and everything came out piping hot and fresh. M R Always busy here. But we were able to get a table without waiting long. They are very efficient and courteous. The food is well prepared, presented, delicious and generous. Price is a bit on the high side but again generous servings. Ordering is a breeze with the QR code system and you know what you are paying for. Just make sure tea charging is for the right number of people. I have to say again they are very efficient! ENKI'S FUN TECHNO STUFF (EnkiTrillionaire) We visited Mr Lobster’s Private Kitchen a few weeks ago with a group of family and friends (there were nine of us). We made a booking in advance and were seated at a large table with a lazy Susan, which made sharing easy. We ordered a range of dishes from the menu—everything sounded amazing, and each dish had its own unique flavour. The standout for us was definitely the Peking duck. The crispy skin, juicy meat, and the combination with the wrap and veggies were just perfect. We also really enjoyed the green beans, roast pork, spicy chicken, and BBQ fried noodles—they were all packed with flavour. The only downside was the slow service. It seemed like dishes were being made and served one table at a time, which is understandable, but with so many other groups there, it meant we waited over 30–40 minutes before the food started arriving. A bit longer than we’re used to, even at busy places. That said, once the food came, it was worth the wait—just something to keep in mind if you're heading there during peak hours. Sang Hyun Kim Probably the best yum cha spot in Auckland! The food quality here is definitely a step above other well-known places. We came for a Saturday brunch with my family and my wife's family, and the place was already busy right from opening at 11am. Every table was full by lunchtime, so I was glad we had made a booking! Ordering was super easy using their QR code system, which showed clear photos of each dish. It was really helpful for choosing what we wanted. We ordered quite a variety, including their popular black truffle dumplings, steamed prawn dumplings, Mr. Lobster deep-fried prawn paste in shredded pastry, deep-fried spicy beans for salad, and a lobster congee to share, along with a few more dishes (not all pictured). Dish highlights: - Black Truffle Dumplings: Absolutely my favourite! There are two versions, and both were rich, fragrant, and full of truffle aroma - a must-try. - Steamed Prawn Dumplings: Fresh, juicy, and perfectly cooked - classic done right. - Deep-Fried Prawn Pastry (Mr. Lobster): Super crispy on the outside and beautifully tender inside. Loved every bite. - Spicy Beans for Salad: Crispy, flavourful, and surprisingly addictive. - Lobster Congee: Smooth, comforting, and generous with lobster - perfect for sharing. Even though the restaurant was packed, the staff were friendly, quick, and attentive. They took the time to answer our questions and made sure we had everything we needed. I have been here a few times now and have never been disappointed. They do yum cha only in lunch time, so it was important to us meeting in lunch time. The only downside is that prices are higher than other yum cha places, but the quality and flavour kinda justify it. Highly recommended, and make sure to book ahead. Michael Kang We have been several times for yum cha and once for dinner. The staff are very friendly and speak English. For yum cha you order on an app which has pictures and is in English and Chinese. They do have a physical menu but encourage to order on the app. There is no trolley service. Food is very tasty and a great variety. Pictures only show the few items we had. Highly recommend yum cha. You must book. The carpark can get busy but u can register your car with the restaurant to avoid getting towed or a ticket. Dinner is also very good with great service.

Resetting your password is straightforward and secure. Click \"Forgot Password?\" on the login page, enter your registered email address, and check your inbox for a reset link. This link remains active for 24 hours. Click it to create a new password following the security requirements: minimum 8 characters including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. Once reset, you'll receive confirmation and can immediately log in with your new credentials. Can I use multiple devices to log in? Yes, Fortunica Casino allows simultaneous access from multiple devices. You can seamlessly switch between your desktop, tablet, and smartphone without logging out. Each device maintains its own session, though for security purposes, unusual device patterns may trigger verification requests. The platform synchronises your account balance, game history, and preferences across all devices in real-time. What should I do if my account is locked? Account locks typically occur after five consecutive failed login attempts as a security measure. Wait 30 minutes for automatic unlocking, or contact customer support for immediate assistance. Have your username and registered email ready for verification. Support agents can unlock your account after confirming your identity through security questions or document verification. Is it safe to stay logged in on my device? On personal devices, staying logged in is generally safe thanks to Fortunica Casino's security features including session timeouts and encryption. However, always log out on shared or public devices. The platform automatically logs you out after 20 minutes of inactivity. For optimal security, enable two-factor authentication and avoid using the \"Remember Me\" feature on devices others can access. How long does the login process take? The standard Fortunica Casino login takes approximately 5-10 seconds on a stable internet connection. First-time logins after registration may take slightly longer due to initial security checks and verification processes. If two-factor authentication is enabled, add 10-15 seconds for code entry. During peak times or system updates, slight delays may occur, but login should never exceed 30 seconds under normal circumstances. Why am I getting a \"Region Restricted\" message? This message appears when accessing Fortunica Casino from a restricted jurisdiction or when using VPN services. Australian players should disable any VPN or proxy services and ensure they're accessing the site from within Australia. If you're travelling, contact customer support to discuss temporary access options. The casino must comply with geographical restrictions as part of its licensing requirements. Important Login Security Tips Password Management Excellence Create passwords with 12+ characters when possible Use password managers for secure storage Never use passwords from other accounts Avoid predictable patterns or personal information Update passwords immediately if breach suspected Secure Connection Requirements Always verify HTTPS connection (padlock icon) Avoid public WiFi networks for casino access Use personal mobile data when travelling Keep home WiFi password-protected Consider VPN for extra security (where permitted) Account Protection Measures Enable all available security features Regular account activity reviews Set deposit and session limits Monitor email for unauthorised access alerts Keep contact information updated Login Safety Recommendations Never share login details via email or chat Log out completely after each session Clear browser data on shared computers Report suspicious account activity immediately Bookmark the official site to avoid phishing Verify customer support contacts before sharing information",

Part 2 Soul Sriracha Fake Plastic Trees WTFaith? Part 1 Ikigia, Part 1 - What gets you up in the morning Ikigia, Part 2 - What gets you up in the morning Bex's story Join the Loop About Give Online The Light House Church believes in the teachings of Jesus, we believe in being culturally relevant, creative, and inclusive. We've created an environment that's far from a traditional religious setting, a culture that reflects Wanaka and it’s contemporary community. TELL ME MORE ABOUT IT Join us this Sunday (Nov 23) for Bedroom Poetry: The Bible’s steamiest book and why it matters today. Desire. Consent. Boundaries. Before marriage, before rules, before shame — the Song of Solomon shows us a picture of passion and longing that’s honest, poetic, and sacred. We’ll talk about what it means to navigate sexuality with integrity in a modern world — without guilt, fear, or legalism. You’ll laugh, maybe blush a little, and definitely see the Bible in a way you haven’t before. The Big Story: Christianity 101 — Week 4 , This Thursday, 6:30 pm | The Lighthouse, Wanaka . Join us for Part 4 of The Big Story — our four-week crash course on what Christianity is really about. Every Sunday 6-7pm service | 28 Reece Crescent , Wānaka (Walk right to the back of the car park behind Guthrie Bowron & up the flight of stairs, follow the signage) There is way to much beauty in Wanaka to not enjoy those delight hours in Gods creation. We find a short punchy night service to be exactly what people love. One hour long with a hangout after, is plenty of time for some amazing worship and a short punchy message. A message that is relevant for people weather they have been in church there entire life's or maybe don't even believe in God but still come as it's a fun space to be. We can't wait to meet you and make you feel really welcome. Grab a free beverage, take a seat on a couch and enjoy the ride! FAQ Where and when is the service? Every Sunday 6-7pm service | 28 Reece Crescent , Wānaka (Walk right to the back of the car park behind Guthrie Bowron & up the flight of stairs) What do you do in your service? The service is only 1 hour. The band plays a few songs & different people might chat. Then for 20 minutes we have a professional communicator talk around a topic that is practical from the bible or life. After the service we hang out, catch up and meet new friends. There are complementary drinks (beer, cider, coke etc) in the fridge for during or after the service. What should I wear? Whatever, most of us are super casual. We are more concerned about you being comfortable and relaxed than the clothes you wear. Do I have to give money? Certainly not, if you are a guest the service is a gift to you. We do encourage our regular community to give but it is never pressured. Do I need a bible or something? Most people these days just download YouVersion on the app store. But all the bible scriptures used in the service will be on screen anyway. What do you do for the kids? We encourage older kids to enjoy the service and certainly all kids to enjoy the music. Many younger teenagers love the service as the speaking is interesting, often funny and certainly helpful. For the younger kids (when we know they are coming) we feed them dinner free of charge during the 20 minute talk. Your kid can either stay with you or eat with the other kids and make friends. Whats the music like? We have a full band and although all our songs are about faith they are played in a relevant way. Many of them have a distinct Reggae\/Grunge New Zealand vibe to them. Got a Question? LOCATION Sunday 6pm 28 Reece Crescent , Wānaka What people Are Saying Greenwood Absolutely love this church. Super relaxed and chill yet totally about Jesus and loving others. Felt really welcoming and accepting. The worship was so good and loved the atmosphere. The sermons are amazing and really relevant to everyday life. Would highly recommend this church to anyone. Naomi Awesome church, great music, heaps of young people, really funky space and a super relevant message. Definitely will be coming back Pete Awesome presence of God!

At Paeroa College, we prioritise academic excellence while fostering individual growth. We prioritise strong partnerships with whānau and uphold the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi. This ensures every student's learning journey is personalised and tailored to their unique needs and aspirations. Our flexible and integrated curriculum places student needs at the forefront of every learning experience. This personalised approach empowers all students to achieve their NCEA goals and confidently pursue their desired pathways, whether it's further education, vocational training, or entering the workforce. Our dedicated team of Deans, Counselors, Nurses, and Careers Advisors collaborate closely to provide comprehensive pastoral support for all our young people. This holistic approach ensures they receive the care and guidance necessary to thrive academically, socially, and emotionally. Beyond academics, Paeroa College thrives on sporting and cultural excellence. Our Kapa Haka group is a treasured tradition, both for the school and the wider community. We boast a strong sporting legacy, with successful teams in rugby, touch, football, basketball, netball, motocross and lacrosse. These teams consistently achieve high standards, often claiming top spots in local Hauraki and Thames Valley competitions. Our four Houses – Tara, Ngakotu, Rapiri, and Maru – are the heart of our school spirit. The House competition fosters a vibrant school culture by recognising all aspects of school life, from attendance and academic achievement to sports and community service. It provides every student with valuable opportunities to contribute and celebrate their daily successes. Paeroa College is deeply connected to our community. We actively engage in service projects and strive to be positive contributors to the town we call home. While we may be a smaller school, we possess a big heart and a strong sense of pride in both Paeroa and our college.

Starting out on the roadside by the Lowry Bay Yacht Club the café has grown in size from one caravan to an additional container, deck and jetty, to a 3m x 9m portacom kitchen and servery. Being substantially bigger, this new space has given Compass Coffee the opportunity to extend their food range as well as provide total shelter and comfort when ordering in this very unique facility.

Would recommend, especially if you havent had Phillipino food before 🙌🏽 Jayden Fairbairn-Lowe (Jayden) Filipino vibes. We were hesitant at first as there were no customers. But the staff and owner is friendly. We had sisig, kare-kare, lumpia, pancit and 2 drinks (frappe and blue curacao). I just have one problem with the lumpia rolls, it was a bit bland without the sweet chili sauce. But everything was delicious! Different delicacies of Pinoy foods 🤤 We took home buco pie and puto, I can tell that the puto was days old. But buco pie was yummy! We hope to go back and explore Matamata again soon. Katherine Rose Huizo It was quite warm in the restaurant. The lady who served us was friendly and chatty. The food was pretty good but small portions though. It is worth a try if you are in the area and craving for Asian food. STP I am Filipino, and I can confidently say that the Filipino food at Food Trip tasted great! The service is warm and friendly. Would 100 percent go again, in fact we went twice during our stay at Matamata because it was just that good!

Reviews Basic Accommodation with a Great View Reviewed 24 Nov 2015 Although this motel is quite basic it had everything we needed for our one night stay. We had an upstairs room with a magnificent view of Mt Ruapehu where we relaxed on the balcony having a quiet drink soaking in the view. It was a short stroll to the restaurant area and there were quite a few to choose from. We enjoyed our stopover in Ohakune. HormuzV Great Customer Service! Reviewed 20 Jul 2015 Pleasant stay, nice and quiet. The rooms are basic but very clean and comfortable. After a day on the mountain we loved a soak in the hot tub. The hotel is located about five minutes walk to the town centre. Reception was very welcoming and friendly. They went out of their way to accommodate our needs. I would definitely stay here again. xAnjax Good Clean Accommodation Reviewed 22 Sep 2014 We were away on a lads trip away. The Accommodation was nice, clean and comfortable. We didn't spend a lot of time here but definitely served its purpose as a place to stay and play for a group of lads. Bed, hot showers and clean towels... All we needed. We had four rooms and each room was a little different with layout and beds, some had cooking facilities and some didn't. This wasn't a problem for us, I'm sure you can ask for any type of room you require here. We ate out so we only needed basics. Motel a 2min walk to main centre of town with supermarket, restaurants, cafés and bars, great location.

It has also been reviewed as one of the 'ten must-see New Zealand Airbnb spots' by the New Zealand Herald. Book directly with us for the best rates, guaranteed. Here's why we were reviewed so highly. Watermark Villas apartment with panoramic riverfront views Perhaps the first thing you will notice when you arrive at your Riverside Apartment are the amazing views. Floor-to-ceiling double glazing allows panoramic vistas of the wide, blue Waikato River passing below and across to the green open space of the domain. These views can be taken in from the kitchen, dining, living area, balcony and the master bedroom - they are truly spectacular. Riverside Apartment - 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms Tell me more Sleeps up to six people Two queen sized beds are complimented by two single beds in the third bedroom. A portacot is also available. The master bedroom takes in the same magnificent view that the living and dining areas overlook. The living area is wonderfully arranged all on one level making living easy. Spacious, beautifully finished and furnished you'll feel at home immediately. Spread out, enjoy the space and relax so that you truly enjoy the view that the apartment offers over the river to the tree-lined domain. Kick back on the balcony to enjoy the late evening sun and enjoy the serenity that this tranquil riverfront apartment can offer. Stunning water views and fully self-contained Self catering, well-appointed kitchen and dining area You can prepare meals in the fully appointed kitchen and savour a glass of wine while taking in the relaxing, views of the river gliding past the front of the apartment. The kitchen is fitted with oven, ceramic hob, range hood, microwave oven, fridge\/freezer, Nespresso machine and other small appliances. Or, a ten minute stroll finds you in the centre of Taupo township, with its many restaurants, bars, cafes, boutique art galleries and shops. Riverside Apartment is conveniently placed close to Taupo town but enjoys absolute tranquility, away from roads and noise. Taupo and Lake Taupo - The Tongariro Alpine Crossing and much more Found on the shore of Australasia's largest fresh water lake, Taupo is world famous as New Zealand's North Island playground. Adrenaline-pumping activities include bungy-jumping, jet boating, white water rafting and skydiving. If that's just a little too much excitement you can bike the lake trails, hike through native bush or explore the many cultural and historical sites in the area. Check out the many things to do including the famous Tongariro Alpine Crossing . Home to a series of events (mostly in summer) the Taupo domain and amphitheatre is literally just across the river from our apartment - so you can open up the sliding doors and listen to concerts for free and from the comfort of the apartment! Check out our events page for more information on future concerts and we also have some Taupo kid-friendly activities that we can recommend. The thermal wonderland that surrounds Taupo offers a glimpse into its fiery origin. Lake Taupo was predominantly created by a volcanic blast some 26,000 years ago - geysers, boiling mud pools and warm, geothermal hotpools are all within easy reach of Riverside Apartment. Wind down in one of the town's many cafes, bars or restaurants - or indulge in perhaps the best view of all from the lounge of our apartment and plan what lies ahead for tomorrow. Free Wifi, free Netflix and more. Riverside Apartment has, in addition to the curved TV, free and unlimited wifi (a high-speed fibre connection).

    "homepage_content":"About Thorndon - Thorndon Residents Association About Thorndon Our neighbourhood is a unique mix of residential households (including Victorian era villas, workmen cottages and apartments) and government buildings and offices. We have two beautiful cathedrals, numerous educational institutions and important historic buildings and sites. Thorndon is the oldest suburb in New Zealand and lies at the northern end of Wellington’s central business district. It is flanked by the green town belt on Te Ahumairangi Hill to the west and the port facilities of Wellington Harbour to the east. We acknowledge with appreciation the funding support we receive from Wellington City Council. Thorndon’s History Thorndon is a suburb steeped in history. As well as being home to Parliament, it also contains several sites of particular significance in Wellington, such as Katherine Mansfield House, Old St Paul’s, and one of New Zealand’s oldest public houses, the Thistle Inn. Built in the 1960s, the Wellington Urban Motorway cut through Thorndon, separating its largely residential area with its business area. Close to the city centre, the railway station and motorway make the suburb’s heritage sites easily accessible. Thorndon also houses several embassies and consulates, such as the Australian High Commission, as well as the embassies of the Republic of the Philippines, Germany, and Cuba. It is also the official residence of the French Ambassador. Architecture Being one of New Zealand’s oldest residential suburbs, Thorndon has a diverse architectural history. Settlers surveying and building in Thorndon in the 1840s divided the land into one acre sections, which is still evident within the area today. Because of its steep landscape, parts of Thorndon has architecture unlike anywhere else in New Zealand. The social divisions of the 19th century are clear in the division between the large houses built on the flat land in the north of the suburb, and the workers’ houses built on the sloped landscape to the south. There was a surge in prosperity by the turn of the century, and many substantial homes were designed by leading architects. William Clayton – New Zealand’s first and only colonial architect – designed many significant buildings in Wellington, but is perhaps best known for designing Parliament buildings and Government House. He also constructed the first building in the country made of concrete, a house on Hobson St which has been incorporated into Queen Margaret College. Katherine Mansfield House is an example of houses built in the economic depression of the 1880s. Devoid of decoration, it lacks the ornamentation of houses in Thorndon that were built in more prosperous times. Ernst Plischke, an Austrian architect was one of the key figures to introduce modernism into Thorndon architecture after the Second World War, and worked on designs for housing blocks to be built in Wellington by the government. The Wellington Urban motorway cut through the area in the 1960s, which resulted in the destruction of about 400 houses. This led to a greater awareness of Thorndon’s heritage, and in the 1970s the Thorndon Society and Thorndon Trust were formed to preserve and protect the areas historic buildings. Remove Graffiti from Thorndon A Thorndon Residents’ Association communication initiative; collaboration between WCC and residents. The aim is to help protect the community from property vandalism in the form of graffiti. Vandalism locations, patterns and clean-up response stand-out when they are tracked on an interactive map. Click here to view the Safety and Graffiti map . Character Zone Because of Thorndon’s rich history, with many of its buildings providing a snapshot in time of the mid-nineteenth century, Wellington City Council has decided to ensure new buildings in Thorndon adhere to a code to protect its special character. The majority of buildings in Thorndon are over 90 years old, so the code have been prepared to ensure all buildings have a certain cohesiveness. The design guide provides the criteria for all prospective buildings, and although is flexible, it ensures all new buildings maintain the character of Thorndon.

It is a Vietnamese soup consisting of broth, bánh phở (rice noodles), simple herbs and vegetables, and meat Menus Our Story Begins In The East Cuisine in this country of 70,000,000 people differs strikingly between the north, south and central regions, but two key features stand out. First, rice plays an essential role in the nation’s diet as it does throughout southeast Asia. But this is also a noodle-crazy population, regularly downing them for breakfast, lunch and dinner, in homes, restaurants and at roadside stands. Noodles are eaten wet and dry, in soup or beside soup, and are made in different shapes and thicknesses of wheat, rice and mung beans. Secondly, no meal is complete without fresh vegetables and herbs. A key portion of every meal, north, south and central, is a platter containing cucumbers, bean threads, slices of hot pepper, and sprigs of basil, coriander, mint and a number of related herbs found principally in southeast Asian markets.

    "homepage_content":"KC Cafe And Takeaway | Te Aro | ORDER ONLINE | Takeaway | TuckerFox NZ KC Cafe And Takeaway Asian - Chinese - 4.5 39a Courtenay Pl, Te Aro, Wellington 6011 × Average Customer Rating 4.5 The stir-fried beef ho fun was incredibly fresh and flavorful — definitely a highlight of the meal. The fried chicken wings were a bit on the salty side for my taste, but still crispy and well-cooked. Overall, a very enjoyable dining experience. Highly recommended! 👍 Wu Simon KC has been around for a very long time and rarely closes. Their food is always consistent and they serve up till quite late in the night. Menu is extensive and you’ll often end up wanting to replace your initial choice as there’s too many to choose from! My favourite is the black pepper pork chop and deep fried squid (which you need to eat while it’s hot). The place is often packed so be ready to do takeaways or hang around till one is available. Toilets are at the back however do be careful as the floor might be a tad slippery. Eugene T This place is an institution. Huge menu but doesn't compromise on quality. Had a short wait for a table at 9pm on a weeknight but its always worth the wait. If there are better spring rolls in Wellington I haven’t had them. Luke Dienes Delicous chinese foods. They can cook 160 different dishes with only 2 chefs. Caters many customers. Many takeaways also. Their dishes are not so expensive. Joselyn Lim I can see why this place is a well-loved institution! Ordered our BBQ pork and rice and mi goreng and the food came out lightning-fast and tasted fantastic. Great value too. The amount of menu items is incredible - they really should make a t-shirt with the menu on it as a souvenir R Tran (River) × × - + ADD 0 ATTENTION × Are you sure you want to place this order for tomorrow?
