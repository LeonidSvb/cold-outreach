City Works Depot started life as the Auckland Council Workshops. Developed by the City in 1968 under thure and maintenance departments at a time when the Councilâs own staff fixed streets and maintained parks. Sold by the City in 1992 the property sat largely idle until Tournamentâs purchase in 2012. Â It has since been carefully adapted and restored. The iconic City Works Depot sits between Ponsonby and Freemans Bay to the West and the City to the East. A collaboration of diverse and creative tenancies, we are a neighbourhood of businesses that make and create.

Gallery Local Activities: Ask Us Stay & Visit Great Attractions News From Us 21 May 21 May Read All News Testimonial The hosts were incredibly friendly, helpful and made us feel welcome. My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed our one night stay last weekend. We stayed in a studio room, it was super tidy, very comfortable and the perfect size for us. The bathroom was lovely, most importantly, the hosts were incredibly friendly and helpful and made us feel welcome the minute we arrived. Will definitely stay here again next time we visit Hamilton. Stayed July 2014, travelled as a couple Review by sarahbearnzon Tripadvisor Sarah Bearnzon , Traveller “Customer service – it does still exist.” 4 of 5 starsReviewed 1 week ago We had booked only night stay, on a return trip from the USA to Aus, to watch the Chiefs and Force rugby. A early flight arrival meant we arrived in Hamilton @7.30am, tired and before anything was opened. We went to reception and asked if there was any chance we could check in. The guys could not have been more accommodating and sorted it right out and even brought a cooked breakfast to our room. The rooms are a motel style, but very modern and clean and ticked all the boxes for me, including the best shower i think i have ever had. Thanks so much for looking after us and i would certainly go back when in Hamilton. Stayed April 2015, travelled as a couple John Smith , Travellers “Ideal location to get to the Rugby” We had an upstairs unit, with a small balcony, in this new motel. The well appointed rooms really were super clean. Just a short walk to the Stadium made the trip to the game really enjoyable. The supermarket & places to eat were in walking distance too. Only one tiny issue – the kitchenette – the microwave is on (what was for me) a high shelf, which was a tad difficult to manage when removing hot food. Stayed April 2015, travelled with family Cigar0 , Traveller",

An overview of queer New Zealand Aotearoa New Zealand is a liberal nation. We were the first country to give all women the vote, and we have had openly lesbian, gay and transgender members of parliament. We’ve recognised same-sex civil unions since 2005 and made same-sex marriage legal in 2013. Our Human Rights Act means people cannot be discriminated against on the basis of their gender or sexuality. This includes allowing people to use the toilet that matches their gender identity, and many businesses and public places have unisex or gender-neutral facilities. Our country is nuclear free, and we have a reputation for being clean and green. These factors together with our beautiful landscapes, unique wildlife and bountiful seas make New Zealand a ‘must do’ destination. Look out for the summer Pride festivals in most cities, and events such as the AIDS Foundation’s Big Gay Out early in the year. Your LGBTQ+ Kiwi experience awaits you.

In 1983 the house was moved forward to build behind it. The house is associated with several notable Wellington families, in particular John Plimmer ‘the father of Wellington’. Plimmer’s grandson bought the house in 1911 and it stayed in the family until 1960 when it was sold and used as a home, office, and wool store. Since 1971 it has housed various restaurants with the Boulcott Street Bistro being there since 1991. Downloadable(s) Download this content as PDF close History Plimmer House, situated at 99 Boulcott Street, is associated with the Plimmer family of Wellington, after whom Plimmer’s Steps, Plimmer’s Emporium, and Plimmer’s Ark are named. It is a rare example of the Victorian Carpenter Gothic style in Wellington City, and although it stands crowded by modern high rise buildings, it retains its original integrity and donates its heritage character to the streetscape. The house is thought to have been designed by Charles Tringham for Eustace de Bathe Brandon, a son of Alfred de Bathe Brandon a well known early settler and the founder of the law firm which still bears his name. Eustace had the house built, costing £400, as a wedding gift for his new wife Anna Marie Watson. The house was constructed by Scoular and Archibald, later responsible for the construction of Government Buildings (1876), and they had a mortgage over the house. Thomas Scoular bought the house from Brandon in 1878. In 1901 Scoular died and the house was bought from his estate by Frederick Roach, however, he could not meet the terms of his mortgage, and in 1911 the National Bank sold the house to Isaac (Harold) Plimmer, the son of Charles Plimmer and the grandson of the man dubbed the ‘father of Wellington’ John Plimmer. The house was hardly lived in by the Plimmer family, as Harold Plimmer died at Gallipoli and left the house and all his other possessions to be divided among his remaining family – his father, mother, and two sisters, Girlie and Mollie – who lived nearby at 93 Boulcott Street. However, this letter did not come to light until Charles Plimmer’s death and in 1934 a legal settlement of his estate gave the house to his sister Girlie. She did not occupy the house until the last years of her life and died in 1958. It is not known who occupied the house during the period it was owned by the Plimmers. In 1960 the house was sold to wool broker Leo Tattersfield and used as a home, office, and store. He is responsible for renaming it Plimmer House. By 1969 the house was again on the market, and the Wellington City Council approved plans to re-use the house as a restaurant, to be named Ancoto. It finally opened in 1971, after considerable alterations were made. Thereafter the house was primarily associated with dining. In 1983 the house was under threat from the construction of a modern apartment building, it was finally decided to move the building forward on its site so that the new building could be erected behind it. Since 1991 Plimmer House has been occupied by the Boulcott Street Bistro, a popular restaurant. The house has been through some alterations since being the home of Boulcott Street Bistro, but has retained its heritage values throughout, and its conversion to a restaurant has undoubtedly ensured its survival in an otherwise modern high rise environment.

The style of the house is Carpenter Gothic, featuring a steep-pitched gable, decorated fretwork, and a pendant and finial. A small octagonal tower completes this asymmetrical composition. The house is a good example of what is a relatively rare style, particularly in an inner city context. The house is a typical nineteenth century timber construction and has technical value for this reason. The decorative fretwork demonstrates the adaptability of timber in a skilled craftsman’s hands. The interior has been altered extensively, firstly in the 1960s when it was used as offices, and later in 1969 when the architects Craig, Craig and Moller were engaged to upgrade and modify the building for use as a restaurant. In 1983 when the building was moved forward on its site to allow for a high rise development behind, further alterations were carried out. The building was also altered in 1991 and 1995. Materials close Rusticated weatherboard Timber joinery Iron roofing Setting close Situated on Boulcott Street, Plimmer House has a high streetscape value, particularly in comparison to surrounding high rise buildings. Its small scale is offset by the adjacent high-rise buildings, and it is set behind a small front garden with a picket fence which contributes a semblance of authenticity to its much altered setting. close Cultural Value Plimmer House is a fine example of Carpenter Gothic architecture, a style that is relatively rare in Wellington. The picturesque quality of the turrets, steep gables, and decorative barge boards give the house significant aesthetic value. This house is associated with several notable Wellington families, in particular that of John Plimmer ‘the father of Wellington’. Plimmer’s grandson, Harold, bought the house in 1911 and it remained in the family until 1960. This house is held in high public esteem as the only 19th century building surviving in Boulcott Street, it has rarity value, and the decision to move it on its site rather than demolish show this. The establishment of a well regarded restaurant in this building has helped this building to remain popular and have ensured its survival.

We will always stay here when we go to central otago. Thanks - AliceC Lovely room, great host A very nice room, with everything we needed. The proprieter was extremely helpful and friendly and overall this was one of the best motels we've used in our tour of New Zealand. There was a pleasant venue for dinner within a short walking distance. A lovely stay! -Wendy B Weekend trip This motel have the most comfortable King beds ever. I am fussy about sleeping in hard beds, but the owners had all the lovely things I like in a bed. Also spotless. Lovely motel, totally recommend it. Also the town has a really nice feel about it. -Shona M Excellent place to stay Stayed at this motel and was very happy with our time there. The room was very clean & tidy with everything we needed there. The room was only a single room with a bathroom but it was a big room with plenty of space. Definitely reccommend this place to anyone to stay. -gusgus Read more Photo Gallery Our beautiful Central Otago town. Visit, stay and explore for yourself...

Self-contained Accommodation Conference Facilities Free Airport Shuttles & Parking Close to Auckland Airport Local Dining Options Nearby Attractions Terms and Conditions Online Reservations Testimonials Stayed twice, one each end of our trip, overnight stop in Auckland. First room was standard. Certainly great for a overnight stay, booked well ahead so excellent rate which includes free shuttle to airport. Room clean, think recently up dated. Excellent beds & pillows. On way back stayed in a more expensive deluxe room, big, would sleep 4. Again, beds are great. All looks modern. Certainly stay again especially if you book well ahead & get the cheap rates and need accommodation near the airport. – Margaret S Whanganui, New Zealand We chose this place mainly because of the airport shuttle service on offer and car storage availability. We were not disappointed, everything was awesome. The morning we returned from a 12.5 hr flight it was a decent frost, the shuttle was bang on time which was nice and our vehicle had been bought out of the storage area and sitting in the sun to warm up and defrost. The only minor criticism we have is there was quite a step up into the shower cubicle from the floor, otherwise our Unit ticked all the boxes. Will definitely come here again! – cookaborough Rotorua, New Zealand A very convenient location for airport stayovers, free airport shuttle is easy, picked up and checked in within minutes! The room is extremely spacious with excellent facilities from a kitchenette to a little backyard! The man who works here is also lovely and will do anything to help. All in all – excellent value for money and exceptional service! Would definitely recommend 🙂 – Eleanor S",

    "homepage_content":"Italian Restaurant - Cicio Cacio Osteria Newtown Skip to content A me piacciono gli anfratti bui delle osterie dormienti, dove la gente culmina nell’eccesso del canto. A me piacciono le cose bestemmiate e leggere, e i calici di vino profondi. “I like dark crannies of sleeping osterie, where people culminate in the excess of singing. I like cursed and light things, and deep glasses of wine.\" Our Story “It was something like ten or eleven years ago. I was lost and lonely, working as a cook, living in an old motel (The Carillon) in Mount Cook in Wellington, and trying to be a writer. I didn’t have time or will for washing my clothes at the motel, so every Monday on my day off I would walk to Newtown, leave my stuff at a laundry nearby and go to have a coffee at Baobab café. There was an eatery called Manon at the back of an alleyway in front of the cafe. I would spy the restaurant from the little window thinking how cute it was. Manon eventually closed down and the place seemed to be abandoned for years. The place looked as old as it could be in Europe, and decadent and bohemian as all the things I loved. Few years went by and life took over. I married a beautiful Chilean girl who used to cook with me and call me “dictator!”, I learned to speak Spanish like a Chilean, I stopped writing bull… and I got into running some Italian kitchen in town at Mariluca first and then Ombra. Then my friend Luis who runs Viva Mexico next door, passed me the contact of the landlord of that old place in Newtown. The landlord was an old man in an old house in Oriental Bay. He loved that restaurant more than anything he had and he always dreamt to bring it back to life, before it was too late. My wife Patricia, my former business partner and I opened the place with $16.000 dollars, with a name that nobody could pronounce, going against any common sense business rules and with no much hope to survive. We started serving two lonely house made sausages on an empty plate, pouring only Italian wines, and writing menus in Italian. People thought we were nice guys, but won’t make it. And here we are, five years later, celebrating every day the same love for good people, honest food and true wines.” (Giulio Ricatti – chef patron) A CULINARY JOURNEY TO THE HEART OF ITALY... By being an “osteria” we mean that at Cicio Cacio we cook humble Italian food in a family environment. We are passionate about Italian regional cuisine and we pretend to travel the whole peninsula, researching Italian lost recipes. We change the menu every month, following a different city of Italy. If we can do something by hand we will do it, as our famous bread, pasta and sausages. Our goal is to be as authentic as it would be the food you eat at home in Italy. We try to look closer at ingredients, places, people and memories. Our language is the language of simplicity, treated with care and respect. All our dishes, wines and menus are in Italian because Italy is what our “osteria” is about. We invite you to enjoy the trip. Buon Appetito!! the art of wine As for our food, our wine list reflects our travels through Italy and our passion for mysterious and exotic grapes. As home of something like 500 different varieties, Italy is probably the most interesting wine producer in the world. We love our wines and we love our people, and we try to match the two things. Are you a student? Are you an artist? Are you an intellectual, a housewife or a businessman? Are you young or old? Man or female? Poor or rich? We try to have wines for everyone. We like wines that express Italy at its best, keeping the subject easy and democratic. As every other art (or craft) it is a simple thing, really. It is not a headache. It is a pleasure. Drink List Cicio Cacio is not only a restaurant, it is our home. We will light candles and fire, pour wine and play music. As Baudelaire would have said: “We will boil and serve our own heart”.

VIEW COTTAGE With a reputation for peerless fly fishing and generous hospitality, Huka Lodge combines class, discretion and impeccable service in one of the most serene locations on the planet. John Barker Escape Huka Lodge has legendary status in New Zealand, it is spoken about in revered tones. On arrival, I realised there may be more to this place than a fancy room and breath-taking views. Kelli Brett Cuisine I cannot readily articulate just how the property held me in its grasp at first sight. However, it did, and still does to this day. Was it the sheer force and power of the turquoise green waters of the Waikato River on the one hand and all that tranquility and softness on the other? Perhaps it was simply the contradiction of the two. Alex van Heeren Founder, Huka Lodge There are so many things to like: the riverfront setting; the lavish duplex accommodations; and the superb cuisine. It is one of the finest hideaways of its type in the world.

Carts For Hire Kayaks For Hire Reserve We stayed 7 days in the Dotterel Caravan and Awning - With our two grandsons aged 10 and 7 - The caravan was very retro and was well equipped for what we needed - to lie there at night and hear the waves so close, It was magic looking out of the window to see all along the beach. I had to pinch myself. The caravan was a little dated but who cares when you ore literally 10 steps to the safe swimming beach - The awning had two beds for the boys that were really comfortable, we set up a fold out table inside - the deck was well used good wooden picnic table - To sit outside as the sun went down was beautiful - we were also lucky to have beautiful weather - The staff are amazing and so helpful - the cook house and toilets were really nice and clean. So much to do lovely walks - the boys loved riding the 3 wheelers. We couldn't get the Dotterel for next year - But we are booked in the Kereru also right on the beach - Shopping centre was great at Snells Beach for the your supplies and The Warehouse - also some great bakeries. and Takeaways -only10mins drive - I hope we can make this an annual holiday - Will bring a small barbecue next time.. Paradise20315094838, TripAdvisor 2023 Fantastic family time. The camping sites were big and spacious. Great safe swimming beach for children and clean facilities. Great hospitality from the staff.

Simply Indian, the original Motueka Indian restaurant We're now over 20 years old. \"I started work here 10 years ago in front of house as duty manager, and commuted from Nelson every day. I loved coming to work in Motueka and chatting with all the regulars and tourist visitors from far and wide. One day the opportunity to buy the restaurant came up and I jumped at the idea. I liked Motueka, the restaurant and its beautiful clientele so much that I bought it. And so I became the very proud owner of Simply Indian. I had just started a family and we moved to Motueka straight-away to be closer to our new venture. Two of the chefs from those days are the main stay of our kitchen still, ensuring you receive consistent quality dining every time you visit us.

During spring and summer, the scent of lavender is everywhere while the sap rises and the flowers bloom. However, with over 50 different lavenders onsite, we always have lavender in bloom to see and smell. There is much more to the gardens than lavender. The Circle of Thyme is a popular spot to sit in tranquility or meditate; the flowering thyme is a sight to behold. With a wide variety of New Zealand natives and other plants in the gardens, there is plenty to see all year round. Have a picnic surrounded by the scent and colour of beautiful lavender and flower gardens. Enjoy the scenic views from Mt Fyffe to the Kaikoura Peninsula. Entry to the gardens currently costs $5 per person over 15, children free. The charge varies through the season. Refreshments While you are here, enjoy a cup of tea or coffee which you can take into the garden. Accompany it with something from our selection of lavender edibles. Need a more substantial meal? We can provide a picnic lunch for you to enjoy in the gardens or high tea, both of these need to be booked 24 hours in advance. Want a lighter meal? Then try a Devonshire cream tea. Early birds can enjoy a homemade continental breakfast. As we make our bread this must be booked the day before. Don’t miss our amazing selection of homemade lavender ice cream. We have a wide range of flavours of lavender ice cream and vary the selection on offer. With more flavours in the pipeline, not to mention our vegan sorbets, there is sure to be somethiung new to try. Shop The onsite gift shop has a wide variety of lavender products, crafts, and more. You don’t need to love lavender to find something appealing. We make our lavender products using lavender oil and flowers from lavender grown on the farm. During the summer harvest, visitors may be able to see the distillation process when we extract essential oil from the plant. We produce pure essential lavender oil, blends for massage, moisturisers, toiletries, therapeutic massage creams, room sprays, candles, and food products. View Product Range Craft Onsite, there is a small flock of sheep whose wool we like to spin, weave, knit, and felt to produce a range of goods. You will often find Myra demonstrating these crafts in the shop. We run crafting sessions to allow you to try these crafts yourself.

By 2050, demand is projected to increase by up to 82%, reaching 71.7 terawatt-hours (TWh) Strong Government Backing Policies like the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and renewable energy incentives encourage private investment in clean energy. A Free Market NZ has a deregulated electricity market, allowing consumers to switch power retailers freely, fostering innovation and new market entrants. Download NZ Energy Strategy PDF Why Invest in New Zealand? Safe Haven Discover a country with low crime rates and a stable political landscape, offering peace of mind for investors. Green Energy Leader Benefit from a commitment to sustainability and renewable resources, paving the way for a cleaner future. Free Market NZ market is decentralised, renewable-focused, free trading system, with greater market flexibility, strong policy support, and higher renewable energy returns. Solar Edge NZ has higher solar irradiance than countries such as Malaysia & Singapore. This drives greater yields, and higher returns. NZ Energy Market Insights Free market allows for localised energy prices, largely due to varying distribution costs to various parts and corners of NZ. nz commerce commission - mar 2025 Energy Prices Household electricity bills will increase in April 2025 by about $10 a month (excluding GST), on average. Increasing costs for material and labour, higher interest rates, and rising levels of investment in the electricity network combine to cause this increase. Investment in electricity assets is needed to ensure New Zealanders continue to receive a reliable, safe, and resilient electricity supply. source CONSUMER NZ - SEP 2021 Price Differential The areas with incomes lower than the average are paying higher prices than the average. Larger towns and cities generally pay the least. Coupled with price rises over the past 20 years, the high electricity prices in lower-income areas are contributing to New Zealand's increasing levels of energy hardship and inequality. Northland on average pays 36% higher for electricity than the national average. Auckland pays 5% less than the national average. source INTEREST.CO.NZ - AUG 2024 The Problem to Fix Prices look set to rise for retail users, because wholesale prices have increased. Prices over $1000\/MWhr (megawatt hour) are becoming all-too frequent as the cold winter blast coincides with low lake levels and inflows, and low wind generation. Normal used to be <$100\/MWhr. So NZ is running at least 10 times normal, maybe more. âImage: www.ea.govt.nz source Business Model Partner for Growth At Naumai Partners, we create impactful partnerships that drive renewable energy initiatives.

    "homepage_content":"Peach's Hot Chicken PEACH’S HOT CHICKEN OnLine ORDERING Peach's Hot Chicken Online Order Our Story Nashville Hot Chicken is fried chicken tossed in spice, traditionally served on white bread with pickles. The style was born in Nashville, Tennessee, in the 1970s and remains a much- loved staple across the United States. At Peach’s, we faithfully recreate this iconic Nashville dish with the highest quality ingredients, authentic flavour, and a recipe that comes straight from the source. Alex and Olivia George started Peach’s in a little food truck in late 2017, bringing a generations-old Nashville hot chicken method from Alex’s grandmother. With years of experience in high-end restaurants and hotels, they wanted to create a place that reflected how they like to dine out. To sum it up, they wanted to serve delicious comfort food in a casual, fun, atmosphere with great service. In 2019, team Peach decided to bring the love to their home suburb of Panmure with a brick-and-mortar shop. Alex and Olivia were overwhelmed with the amazing support of our community and the city of Auckland. After three years in their original premise, they decided team Peach was gonna need a bigger shop and moved just down the road, where we’re still serving today. From the start, Peach’s has been about doing things right. All our chicken is free range, antibiotic-free, butchered daily by our talented team, and prepared fresh to order. Once you pick your spice level, you can have it served on classic white bread with pickles, in a soft toasted bun as a burger, atop fluffy Belgian waffles or even in a house-made biscuit. It’s Nashville hot chicken done right. Thank y'all so much for being a huge part of this journey! Reservations Plan your visit to Peach’s Hot Chicken for a flavour-packed dining experience.

I used them for my 40th Birthday Dinner with a group of friends. They took care of everything and were an absolute delight to deal with. They literally turn up and in the blink of an eye you're enjoying the most amazing meal, and then they quietly tidy everything away and head off. It meant I was able to relax and really enjoy the evening. I highly recommend them and I'd use them again.\" Toni Cooper At Your Service Email: info@saltandseed.co.nz Tell us a little about your event so we can begin the creation process Name Email Message Submit Thanks for submitting!

This 1951 Leyland house bus has undergone multiple transformations and at least 10 coats of paint since it was first parked up in 1999. Since then, Blair has obsessively filled the bus with his automata creations, donated curios and personal memorabilia. Winding handles and pushing buttons will bring them to life. Free admission.

Blair Somerville came to Papatowai over two decades ago. He’s the tinkerer, the fiddler, the maker of movement. The Lost Gypsy is his life project, and almost all that you see is by his hand. His (now) fiancée, Sandra van der Sommen, came to meet Blair in 2018, and it was love at first sight. She draws and paints, and generally tries to raise the standard of the place.

We opened in Greytown in 2015 and focused on providing a friendly, welcoming atmosphere in which our diners can enjoy our fabulous food served by our knowledgeable staff. We then opened Aroma India Silverstream in January 2018 and Aroma India Martinborough in July 2021. Our Food We serve innovative, fresh meals cooked to order which is why you sometimes have to wait for your meals to be ready. We mix our own spices in-house rather than using ready-mixed packets to help contribute to the freshness of our food. We also make our own paneer in-house as you will be able to tell from the âsqueaksâ it makes when you eat it. All of these factors contribute to the âAroma India flavourâ. Private Function Over the years, we have seen many celebrations and we are happy to cater to large groups and allow the restaurant to be decorated within reason. If you are bringing young children that need to be given something to eat quickly, please us know and we will do our best to help you to get them settled so that you can all enjoy your evening. ORDER ONLINE NOW Customer Reviews Listen to what our customers say about us Karen âWe LOVE Aroma India. The food is always fabulous and the service friendly. The restaurant has a nice modern feel to it and does not feel crowded even when full. We are never hurried when we are there and feel that we can take our time eating. Although Iâm not a vegetarian, some of my favourite dishes are the paneer, the mushrooms and the dal makhani. I also love the Hariayala Murgh. The portions are a good size, particularly the biryanis. The chefs are very approachable and happy to show-off the kitchen.â Rob ââComing from the UK and being local in Greytown, we were very excited about a new Indian Restaurant in our town. When we tried it and found it to be consistently the best curry in New Zealand, we were blown away. We can definitely recommend our favourite dishes which are Hariayala Murgh and Malabari Fish.â Chris âWith the arrival of âAromaâ, Greytown can now boast as having the best Indian Restaurant in the Lower North Island. The ambience and style is warm and inviting, the staff always attentive friendly and happy. The menu is wide and varied but must-try dishes are the Garlic Chicken Tikka, the Hariayala Murgh, Lamb Masala and the Chicken Korma. After several visits, itâs always a great feeling that the staff recognise you and always make you feel special. Dining-in or taking-out, nothing is an issue, and home delivery is always a massive bonus on cold winter nights!! â Maureen âOne of the best Indian restaurants in the Wellington region. My husband and I go there several times a month for lunch or dinner as the menu is extensive, authentic, and the staff is exceedingly friendly and attentive. Dishes can be made to-order and Aroma has one of the best combination of spices, sauces, and fresh ingredients. An added bonus, we have taken our young Grandchildren there on occasion and they too are made to feel equally welcome. I highly recommend Aroma for anyone wanting a great Indian meal!â Colin âBefore dining at aroma india Iâd had Indian food half-a-dozen times but found its a little dry and not to my taste. We moved to Greytown 2 years ago and my wife asked me to try Aroma India. I found the restaurant to be clean and inviting, and the owner and staff pleasant and eager to chat. I now love Indian food â itâs always fresh and very tasty. My favourite is their chicken khorma (medium) with their delicious garlic naan. We like to eat there once a week. The first time we went there we asked for ice in our wine â strange but true! The second time they remembered us and asked if we would like ice! AMAZING! GREAT STAFF, GREAT FOOD.â Chelle âAroma has added some delicious spice to our life! We love trying something new each visit and appreciate being able to specify the level of spice. The hariyala murgh is delicious.â Previous Next LOCATION 74-76 Main Street, Greytown 5712, New Zealand 06 304 8080 069298209 aromaindia38@gmail.com Phone 06 304 8080, 069298209 Email aromaindia03@gmail.com Location 74-76 Main Street, Greytown 5712 ↑",

We opened in Greytown in 2015 and focused on providing a friendly, welcoming atmosphere in which our diners can enjoy our fabulous food served by our knowledgeable staff. We then opened Aroma India Silverstream in January 2018 and Aroma India Martinborough in July 2021. Our Food We serve innovative, fresh meals cooked to order which is why you sometimes have to wait for your meals to be ready. We mix our own spices in-house rather than using ready-mixed packets to help contribute to the freshness of our food. We also make our own paneer in-house as you will be able to tell from the âsqueaksâ it makes when you eat it. All of these factors contribute to the âAroma India flavourâ. Private Function Over the years, we have seen many celebrations and we are happy to cater to large groups and allow the restaurant to be decorated within reason. If you are bringing young children that need to be given something to eat quickly, please us know and we will do our best to help you to get them settled so that you can all enjoy your evening.

I got stuck in Auckland for a couple of weeks and was staying nearby - this place caught my eye so went in to try. Food was really great, very tasty and a great price. I enjoyed it so much i went back again a few nights later! Would recommend all to try it. Andrew This place has become my goto Turkish eatery. In my opinion the best lamb in Auckland and the rice is cooked so perfectly fluffy. The eatery is open late and I like to bring my friends here. The team is also very friendly. Dan Absolutely beautiful meals. We had the Lamb Shish Kebab and Mixed Platter . The lamb was perfect and so delicious. Both meals flavorsome and extremely enjoyable. We both so enjoyed our meals and our time at the little Turkish café. We will be making this a regular place to eat. The service was friendly, welcoming, flawless.3 Lynette Stumbled across this awesome little cafe in Auckland during my weekend stay. We ordered the lamb on chips and a meatlovers pizza. The food was very good quality and tasted delicious. The pizza's are woodfired and it was perfectly done. The lamb on chips\/lamb snack pack was also very tasty and filling. Thank you very much!

Warmest welcome from Richard with an extensive selection of delicious treats to make the stay that little bit more special. Great location, less than 5 minutes from the local restaurants and bars .

Definitely recommend this motel for couples or families. Welcoming host who had no problem waiting for our late arrival. - Maggie Read Very helpful Great owners - sorted out making sure I could get into my room after my ferries were cancelled\/delayed and generally running very late. Awesome to have that flexibility and helpfulness. Also nice and quiet to get a good nights sleep which helped! - pihatony Start of a road trip Spent one night in the middle of winter at the Marton motel. I could have stayed the whole week. Our twin bed room had everything we needed. It was well maintained and comfortable. The room was warm and welcoming. As for the shower I have never had such strong water pressure any where before. Fantastic location, Friendly reception, Easy parking. A great place to start our week. - Gary M Overnight stay after a Strait ferry crossing Easy place to find - nice and quiet. Very clean and tidy. Good price. Hosts were friendly and helpful - especially recommending a good place for dining. Warm with the heaters cranked up. Ideal overnight stop to break up our trip. - Brent B Great Value Stayed one night. Arrived 10:30pm, left 10:30am. On line booking, but phoned to say we'd be late. Not a problem. Nice, very clean motel room. Everything worked. Could not ask for more. Made me wonder why you spend more around the country and often get less. Highly recommended! - Alan K I had the pleasure of staying here at Marton Motel over the weekend (Sat and Sunday, July 26th & 27th) 2025. Dear Marton Motel. Right from the get go it was evident how welcoming, professional and friendly the current manager was. Her friendly approach was only surpassed by the immaculately kept room we were in. I've never seen a shower, bench and sink that shiny in my entire life. We were warm and catered for with such care and pride of her rooms that I would not hesitate to highly recommend a stay in this beautifully presented and friendly staff to anyone passing through or in Marton looking to stay. Thank you for a delightful visit. We will definitely stay here again. Kind regards, - Connie Cook Ocean Fresh Takeaways Ltd Golfing Weekend What a surprise! This amazing little motel is a real little ripper, right in the centre of all the golf courses of the area. The rooms were absolutely spotless, and everything was brand new. Amazing huge TV setup, great host, and plenty of parking. The weather was great and the golf was good.

Waipapakauri Ramp is identified as a site of significance and key access point for the iwi of NgāiTakoto on to Te Oneroa ā Tohe \/ 90 Mile Beach. Tohe named many places along Te Oneroa ā Tohe (The Journey of Tohe)\/90 Mile Beach. He was a tohunga and matakite who knew all sacred things. He came to the Waipapakauri Ramp, while making the journey to save his daughter, Rāninikura and named this place ‘ Ngāpae ’ after coming across a whale stranding here.

This year, they discovered a queen yellow legged hornet in the early stages of building a nest in Glenfield on the North Shore in October, while two males were spotted earlier in the year in Grafton and Albany. It is the first time a Queen has been found in Aotearoa.

    "homepage_content":"Quinta Essentia | Montessori Adolescent Center for Studies and Work Montessori Secondary Montessori Land Laboratory Nature's Home for Adolescents Nourishing Sunrise Perfecting Nature Growing with Greens Quiescence at Sunset Need for Change in Education The future is entirely a new kind of world with new kind of needs. There are new types of Jobs to address these changing needs. The needs for new kind of competencies arise to suit these new jobs. Quinta Essentia reflects our founder Maria Montessori’s grand vision for a complete and holistic alternative to today’s deficient education. Nurturing the Adoloscent's Spirit Rather than limiting the child to isolated academic facts, the Montessori child undertakes a path of holistic development that has emphasis on the social and moral development as well as academic. The Perfect Path for Learning Accurately perceiving the major faults in our education system, where students’ real learning of knowledge and skill is buried under increasing pressure to memorise from textbooks in search of marks and exam scores, Montessori showed us the perfect path to develop strong, capable, self-confident adults with the perspective and character to flourish in the world. The Land Laboratory The setting for Quinta Essentia is a rural integrated farm environment, that perfectly meets the needs of the adolescent age students. The farm setting is an ideal learning environment, providing limitless opportunities for the study of all disciplines through practical experience. It becomes a natural laboratory for the study of the natural sciences, where practical investigations and learning help build a passion and depth of knowledge for science. Quinta Essentia's Salient Features Montessori Spaces Designed for Adolescents Large, light-filled studios flex between seminar, lab, and maker-space modes. Moveable furniture and dedicated project zones let students configure their environment to match the flow of research, discussion, or quiet concentration. Community Living on a Working Farm Daily life unfolds within our 20-acre agro-ecological campus. Adolescents share real responsibilities—from tending vegetable beds to managing the farm café—forming a micro-society that weaves cooperation, stewardship, and respect for nature. Mixed-Age Mentorship (A-Level & IGCSE Together) Older students pursuing Cambridge A Levels mentor peers preparing for IGCSE O Levels. This vertical community builds leadership and generosity, while younger learners gain role models who make academic rigour feel attainable. Cultivating Independence & Self-Reliance Learners plan their own study blocks, organise field trips, and oversee campus initiatives. Authentic decision-making nurtures judgement, confidence, and the practical know-how required for life beyond school. Flexible Timetables for Self-Directed Learning Core Cambridge lessons anchor each day, but wide “choice blocks” let adolescents pursue personal research, internships, or creative projects. Weekly planning conferences shift time-ownership from teacher-controlled to learner-managed. Study–Work Cycle for Deep, Real-Life Understanding Chemistry connects to soil testing, statistics to crop yields, economics to café pricing. The iterative cycle—research, apply, reflect—turns academic theory into lived experience, embedding knowledge far beyond exam requirements. Experiential Learning Bringing Subjects to Life The setting for Quinta Essentia becomes a natural laboratory for the study of the natural sciences, where practical investigations and learning help build a passion and depth of knowledge for science. The farm is also a place where small economic production occurs, around which the social organisation is formed. This becomes the basis from which economics, commerce, politics, social studies all originate and can be learnt through real participation. Agriculture is also a lens through which to study history and civilisations, while working on the farm brings a deep awareness and appreciation of our rich past. Multiple constructions and work with mechanics further add the dimension of maths and physics. The farm is thus a perfect prepared environment for study, one that now moves out of the classroom and becomes an introduction to the real world. Learning becomes the perfect preparation for adult life and work. Montessori Secondary Adolescent Philosophy Meeting the Natural Needs of Adolescents Development Following the natural needs of Adolescents and presenting then an environment that successfully meets their needs is the perfect path to develop strong, capable, self-confident adults with the perspective and character to flourish in the world, as envisioned by Dr.Maria Montessori. Farm Setting Perfect Place for Adolescent's Psychic Development & Learning The Farm provides key aspects that aid the development of the Adolescent: Unlimited opportunities for applied study, Opportunities for developing Economic and Social Independence, and the Growth of Character. Residential Life Adolescent Community that develops their Personality The students live in a community where social life and responsibility for managing the community livelihood come together to form an important aspect of the Adolescent Experience. The Outcome Fully Prepared Human for Successful Life Life on the farm forms the backbone of Culture connecting the Power of Sciences, Beauty of Literature, Intelligence of Mathematics, Grandeur of Geography and the Essence of History, from which the construction of the individual personality of the adolescent takes place. Through diverse opportunities for Self-Expression, building language for effective social interaction, and acquiring the means of economic independence through the lived experience of Community Life, the Adolescent acquires a Moral equilibrium characterised by a sense of gratitude towards his universe and goes out into the World as an adult with a Cosmic vision; to live a purposeful and productive life, meeting the expectations of the creator of this method, Dr. Maria Montessori. Our Curriculum Rooting Real-World Readiness. Living Curriculum: Theory Meets Practice Quinta Essentia’s Montessori secondary program weaves seminar-style academics with purposeful farm, kitchen, and enterprise work. Adolescents test ideas in real contexts—compost trials for biology, crop budgets for math—while rotating through community governance and micro-business roles that build independence and social responsibility. The result is a living curriculum that fuses intellectual rigor with meaningful labor, preparing self-directed young adults ready to serve a connected world. Cambridge Credentials Real-World Context Alongside this living curriculum, Quinta Essentia offers the full suite of Cambridge IGCSE, AS and A-Level courses. Students prepare for these internationally recognised examinations through discussion-based lessons, research projects, and guided mastery periods that respect Montessori pacing. Practical work on the farm and in on-site enterprises provides authentic data sets and case studies, turning exam syllabi into lived experience while securing the academic credentials needed for seamless entry into universities worldwide. Know More → Rhythm of Our Farm Life Flow Of The Day Rising with the Sun 5:30 am When dawn colours the horizon, our adolescents rise at 5 : 30 a.m.—not to an alarm, but to the soft sounds of rural life. Waking early places them in rhythm with nature’s cycles, sharpening circadian balance, boosting mood, and setting a calm, alert tone for the day. The shared discipline of rising together nurtures collective responsibility and respect for each other’s time and energy. Mind–Body Morning 6:00 am Yoga and functional exercises on dew-kissed grass build strength, flexibility, and breath awareness. Beyond fitness, this quiet hour encourages mindfulness and emotional regulation, equipping adolescents with lifelong stress-management tools. Practising side-by-side also dissolves social barriers: beginners learn from experienced peers, and everyone starts the day feeling centred and capable. Stewardship in Action 6:30 am Next, we turn inward to serve our shared spaces—sweeping the study hut, tidying the dining pergola, refreshing the community hall. Montessori called this “care of the environment,” and it fosters dignity in labour, pride in surroundings, and an understanding that true freedom is paired with responsibility. Every broomstroke reinforces that this farm is their prepared environment. Morning Huddle & Planning 7:00 am After a warm cup of herbal tea which was made using the herbs from our herbal garden, everyone gathers in a circle to outline the day’s practical work—dividing into planting, weeding, and research teams, confirming tools, and setting shared goals. The brief meeting builds organisation, accountability, and collaborative problem-solving before we head out to the fields. Hands in the Soil 7:15 am Planting seedlings, repairing irrigation lines, or logging compost temperatures turns abstract biology into lived experience. Working side-by-side with guides, students practise planning, tool safety, and data collection, linking manual labour with scientific inquiry. Problem-solving here is immediate and real: a drooping vine or clogged dripper invites hypothesis, experiment, and reflection. Self-Care & Culinary Arts 8:30 am - 10:00 am After showers, the adolescent cooking team serves a farm-to-table breakfast—millet pancakes, moringa chutney, fresh fruit. Cooking at scale cultivates math (portion ratios), chemistry (Maillard reaction), and leadership (co-ordinating timing, hygiene, plating). Sharing a nourishing meal they created cements confidence and communal gratitude. Scholar’s Hut 10:00 am – 1:00 pm Morning academics happen in multi‐age clusters. A subject‐matter guide sparks inquiry, then the cohort breaks into research pods. Elder students mentor younger peers; younger learners ask fearless questions that re‐ignite curiosity in the elders. This self‐directed scholarship mirrors university seminars, preparing them for higher study while honouring each learner’s pace and passion. Midday Respite 1:00 pm – 2:00 pm Lunch is hearty and unhurried; conversations flow from soil microbes to Shakespeare. Downtime afterwards respects adolescent metabolic needs and models healthy work‐life rhythm. Digestive ease enhances afternoon focus, and social bonds deepen over shared plates and laughter. Deep‐Dive Studies 2:00 pm – 4:00 pm Afternoons extend academic or project work: coding an irrigation sensor, drafting a short story, or analysing pond‐water pH. Blocks of uninterrupted time cultivate flow states and executive function—skills essential for complex problem‐solving and creative output. Evening Stewardship 4:00 pm – 4:30 pm A brief return to environmental care closes the academic day. Clearing tools, wiping lab benches, and watering seedlings reinforce the morning’s lesson: knowledge and action are inseparable. Play & Team Spirit 4:30 pm – 5:30 pm Whether sprinting across the football field or strategizing in chess, adolescents refine motor skills, resilience, and ethical competition. Mixed‐ability teams encourage inclusive leadership; rotating sports expose them to varied physical challenges and cultural games like kho‐kho. Creative Economy 5:30 pm – 7:00 pm After a wholesome snack, self‐expression studios hum: paint brushes glide, resin cures, clay wheels spin, guitars strum. Students produce crafts and art that feed our weekly market stall, learning pricing, marketing, and quality control—an authentic micro‐economy that links creativity with real‐world entrepreneurship. Community Hall 7:00 pm Dinner brings everyone together again. Sharing reflections on successes and setbacks cultivates metacognition and empathy. The cooking team receives feedback; tomorrow’s team takes notes—continuous improvement in action. Unscripted Evenings 7:30 pm – 8:30 pm Free time nurtures friendships, spontaneous music jams, stargazing, or quiet reading in hammocks. Autonomy in choosing leisure activities reinforces trust and allows adolescents to explore identity in safe, supportive surroundings. Rest & Renewal 8:30 pm Lights dim, crickets sing, and the farm settles. Consistent sleep routines support hormonal balance and memory consolidation. By honouring rest as essential—not optional—we model holistic health. Beyond the Gate: Field Trips Various Times Experiences like welding a wheelbarrow at Auroville’s Institute of Applied Technology, trekking in Kodaikanal, or studying heritage architecture in Mysore expand our adolescents’ “prepared environment” to the wider world. Each journey delivers fresh skills, cultural literacy, and a broader sense of stewardship that they bring back to enrich farm life. WANT A TRUE MONTESSORI EXPERIENCE? Book a Tour Why Families choose Quinta Essentia India’s First Montessori Secondary School Know More about us → See the Journey in Pictures Stroll through our farm, studios, and joyful community life inside the Quinta Essentia Gallery . Explore the Gallery → Testimonies of Graduates I feel like Montessori really made me more comfortable with who I am because everyone was so kind and felt like a family rather than just classmates. Yacine Creative arts I came from a background where I was not given the opportunity to explore my potential, due to the education system that was being followed. I had a lot of energy and had difficulties remaining focused on the same thing for a longer period, this lead to me falling behind in my education. This all changed when I started at the Montessori farm school. Farm school was an outlet where I could use all that energy that was building up inside of me in an efficient way”. “Thanks to my time at the Montessori farm school I graduated A-level equivalent exams as one of the students with the highest marks and got accepted to one of south-east England’s highest-ranked university. Vilma Business Management The Montessori way of teaching and learning has really helped me with my further studies as I have moved on, as it has given me the ability to work independently with purpose which has meant I have no problem making myself focus and always meeting deadlines with ease. It has also made me confident in my abilities, I know what my strengths are and what I need to work most on to achieve as best I can. Rusa Biology “I also believe that Farm School and the Montessori way has created a strive for knowledge and understanding the world. By not only combining practical work with studies, but also linking them together by applying theoretical knowledge in practical tasks, the Farm School has developed a will to understand this connection between theory and practice in the society”. “The Farm School teaches you things that a regular school does not, such as responsibility, sense of community, independence, economy and the strive for knowledge. All these things are capabilities that are essential for a successful adult life and imagine learning all this during your adolescence instead of learning it the hard way as an adult when moving away from home.” Kristoffer Medicine Get in Touch with Us Our Headquarters are in Chennai and Puducherry Puducherry HO: 27-28, 2nd Cross Moogambigai Nagar Reddiarpalayam, Pondy - 605 010 Phone: +91 9994851951 Phone: +91 9047335818 Email: contact@quintaessentia.in Chennai HO: 24-25, 12th Cross Ranga Reddy Gardens Neelankarai, Chennai - 600 041 Phone: +91 9994851951 Phone: +91 9047335818 Email: contact@quintaessentia.in We are social Name Email Message Send message Click For Admission Call: +91 93613 88617",

What Our Guests Say About Us Angela Barry 5 star review..2 weeks ago.. One of the best high teas I have ever had, and I have had a more than a few. The food was fantastic, contemporary and very well priced. The views are superb even on the rainy day we had. Expansive views and atmospheric. The buildings are well kept and are charming in a retro kind of way. Hotel highlights Great view, Great value Larissa Meira 5 star review.. 5 weeks ago.. Awesome place to stay. Very worth it if you are wanting to relax. Beautiful views, food is amazing. And staff is very friendly Hotel highlights Great view, Romantic Pubudini Prasanna 5 star review.. 3 weeks ago. This is our 2nd winter stay in this hotel. The experience has only got better. The high tea and the dinner were amazing and well presented. My favorites were Thai chicken patty entre and the burrito main which came with a divine cheese sauce. Shout out to the chefs… As always we enjoyed the time in the lounge after the dinner. Staff were very nice and friendly (Reception staff and restaurant staff and cleaning staff and everybody we met). I had a hot oil massage from the spa as well. The ladies at the spa were so nice and special shoutout to the lady with short hair (sorry I forgot your name) her massage had a healing power for my tired back. Love the nature and views around the hotel. Being so close to Auckland yet far away from busy life. Thank you for the relaxing experience and will definitely come back.
