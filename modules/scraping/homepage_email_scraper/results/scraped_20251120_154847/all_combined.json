Getting to many complaints? Being a member for 50+years I have never been so disappointed in the treatment of its members. All has been not to bad up until the recent membership renewal. Since then all that was promised in the membership package has not carried on. Points for purchased items have not been applied. And gift cards will not actuate. One thing happens one week and the same thing doesn't occur the next week. Staff not being trained before they are thrown to the wolves resulting in poor service. If? it does get rectified it takes far to long to do so. I'm wondering how many members are getting short changed on the membership that they have. In a time when things should be simpler and more free flowing its gone backwards. Not good enough SC. By David Eaton, September 05, 2025 Review of \"Happy Corner Store\" at Katherine ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Terrible customer service. Very rude when you asked the old lady twice she would raise her voice. The food is expensive to its quality. Overcooked, it seems like it stayed in the warmer for long hours. Will not recommend this place. Zero stars for me. Buyers beware By Mai, August 24, 2025 Review of \"Yarralumla Gallery and Oaks Brasserie\" at Yarralumla ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ So, I as hugely disappointed. I booked for 10 people (at the request of a birthday girl) and was completely underwhelmed. Firstly, the venue itself was definately not was is portrayed on the website. All the nice things that used to be there are not. The service was abysmal with me having to collect things like water, serviettes etc. We waited in line for what seemed like an age, and it took about an hour and a half for all of us to be served. One friend told me today, she was getting the shakes (she's diabetic) due that wait period. I think you book for 11am, everyone being served by 11.30 is a reasonable expectation. The food was okay - and some things were differen but not really. I don't the $54 price tag just for me was worth it. By Louise, August 19, 2025 Review of \"Fresh Warehouse Direct\" at Seaford ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Is it so much to ask to show on line correct trading hours for the Xmas\/NY period? There is pic showing the hours for all other holidays. Sadly this place is getting worse and more expensive. We have been shopping there since it opened. But gradually it changed for worse. 1 - the blue trolleys are useless. So heavy and have only small basket if you cannot bend down. Now there are also some old dirty but much more useful trolleys, but the trolley bay is right in the middle of large puddle when it rains. With so much space in the front inside, why not get the staff bring them in so people do not have to wade through water to get them? There are some often filthy plastic baskets and baskets on wheels, but that is no good for old and disabled people. 2 - The price signs are often just hung randomly some distance from the actual item. Recently I was buying strawberries; there were 2 different ones, with different prices. But both price signs were directly under one brand, one said Queensland $X and the other board had just price. Directly above the more expensive price the punnet had no info where it came from, then the other strawberries placed diagonally above, had name of company on Mornington Peninsular. So I was surprised when I was charged the higher price, the very rude manager took me back and showed me that while the actual punnet said Mornington Peninsular, the cardboard box in which the punnets sat, clearly states Queensland on its side, which was not visible unless you walked to the side of the stand, which people generally do not do. The non perishable items are even worse; I was told I need to read the stock numbers on the item, and then match them to the price signs placed randomly around the stand. 3 - the quality used to be great; many vegetables looked like they were very freshly picked, and were always cheaper than supermarkets. Now the price is about the same and the quality is often worse. If you try to ask question about the confusing prices etc.,the staff are often rude. The only reason I still shop there now and then is because they have some speciality items I cannot get anywhere else around here. By Lida, January 01, 2025 ✗ Facebook Google Plus Twitter",

Since moving to Sydney, we’ve been taking advantage of opportunities to work at a variety of restaurants, both takeout and fine dining. It provided us with the opportunity to sample a range of dishes from other countries while socializing with a broad group of friends. We wish to expose people to Thai traditional cuisines since we were born and raised in Thailand. This encouraged us to study new ways that assist to put values into traditional food as well as unique ideas to increase its deliciousness, which prompted us to open Aree Thai Twist. Eating Thai cuisine with an Aree Thai Twist allows you to enjoy Thai food through the eyes of the local, with the modification of ingredient utilization accessible in Australia. We use worldwide cooking methods derived from both Chinese and Western skills, as well as touches of Indian, Malay, and Korean fusion-twisted deliciousness, all while maintaining the aromatic fragrance and extraction of herbs for integrity. Aree Thai Twist, as an open kitchen restaurant, will provide you with live cooking from the chefs within the clean kitchen, which you will always be warmly welcomed from the cooking noise by the chef, who will later offer you experiences in the uniqueness of non-traditional Thai dishes, which we guarantee you will enjoy.

Rice is the main ingredient. There are numerous variations, which include shellfish, chorizo, chicken, pork, and vegetables. ​ Spain's best-known dessert is flan, crème caramel. Try one of our beautiful Paellas, Mixta, Seafood, Meat or Veg, and Black Rice with Seafood, or if you prefer, we can make a delicious Mini Seafood Cazuela for you and your guests.

Tasty and fresh with weekly specials that are always amazing. The location, food, style and cold beer all as to make it the perfect spot for a beer and burger Aromny Tyson Whyburn Beautiful feed. Great bunch of workers and amazing service. Shout out to Brendan behind the scenes in the kitchen for cooking the amazing meals Response from the owner: Thank you, Tyson- Attitude Burgers Sandesh Gautam Response from the owner: Thank you!- Attitude Burgers Jason Bolton Well Attitude Burgers is the best feed we had whilst in town.True, it was our only meal. But it was also the best burger I have had in the last 10ths easy ..And there has certainly been a fair number of those. Great chips, top service and friendly as well.The dining room was fine, but my top tip for this place is to take up the takeaway option and go and sit and look at the view of the beach in my photos which is 3-4 min walk away.I hope you enjoy it as much as we did. 🍔I had the true blue which is in my pics, and it was excellent. Response from the owner: Hi Jason,Thanks for this awesome review. So glad you enjoyed your burger!See you next time.- Attitude Burgers Brian Bellamy Great burgers. My wife had a hamburger, mine was a chicken burger. Cooked perfectly. Very tasty. Chips were great.Service was kind, patient, and helpful. Very good place to get burgers.

Over the years we have developed a contemporary style of Pizza focusing on traditional techniques and the use of top-quality ingredients. With a creative mindset and innovative processes, A25 Pizza will always be so distinctive and recognisable and at the forefront of new ways to improve our product. We call it simply the evolution of pizza …. L’evoluzione della pizza!!” OUR PIZZA A25 Pizza serve slow proved pizza with a 72 hr fermentation process using mother yeast.

And so, I began a journey exploring the world of gluten free food and it became my mission to create a menu and environment where Coeliacs would feel confident to eat Italian food that didn’t taste or look any different. Being the first multi-shop Pizza & Pasta restaurant in Australia to be accredited with Coeliac Australia, we have gained a loyal Coeliac and gluten free clientele who enjoy what we believe to be the best gluten free artisan pizza and pasta going around. We take our gluten free products very seriously and have stringent processes in place to minimise any risk of cross-contamination. To all our Coeliac and gluten free families, we love seeing you and giving you an entirely new gluten free dining experience. We would also love to expand our gluten free family and look forward to seeing some new faces in our South Yarra and Melbourne CBD location.” OUR REVIEWS Sign up for the latest A25 news, invites to openings, menu tastings and other fun pizza events.

I found the staff all really helpful and friendly, and the food was excellent. I really enjoyed the different oysters on offer, thoroughly recommend the cioppino (seafood stew) and over indulged with the dessert ... but it was so worth it! Yum! I would definitely eat here again and would highly recommend it. J D. star star star star star_border 2 November 2025 We found this place on TripAdvisor during our drive up the coast. The food was fantastic. We got the seafood platter, which was enough to feed two adults and two kids. The wine selection was incredible, too. Very well chosen, and interesting stuff. The only downside was that it took forever. We were there for almost 2 full hours despite having arrived a little before our 6:30 PM reservation, when there were only a few other tables active. Other than the slow pace, no complaints at all, and I would highly recommend this place. Sara-Fleur S. star star star star star_border 1 November 2025 Really tasty and fresh seafood. The place is really nice. They opened recently. Their deserts are absolutely delicious. It is a little pricy, but not that much compared to other sea food restaurants! Diane A. star star star star star 30 October 2025 This was a great find, excellent meal, very well cooked and presented. I had the roasted barramundi ( yum yum) and my other half had the prawn fettuccine (yum Yum). This place has a great ambience and the staff we very well mannered and attentive. A nice touch was the complimentary cauliflower & white truffle sampler.
