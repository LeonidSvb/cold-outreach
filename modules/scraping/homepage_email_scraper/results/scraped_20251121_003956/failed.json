An important update for readers in the United States . Please don't skip this 1-minute read. Today we're running a short fundraiser to support Wikipedia. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. If so, please join the 2% of readers who give to keep this resource available for all. After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promisedâcreated by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a non-profit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire. Most readers donate because Wikipedia is useful to them, others because Wikipedia is more important than ever. If you feel the same, please donate $2.75 todayâor consider a monthly gift to help all year. Thank you. Please select an amount ( USD ) . The average donation in the United States is around $13 . Many first-time donors give $2.75 . All that matters is that you're choosing to stand up for free, open information; and for that, you have our gratitude. 5 10 20 30 50 100 Other How often would you like to donate?

Proud host of Wikipedia and its sister sites Collapse The internet we were promised After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promisedâ an oasis of free and collaborative knowledge. Today, we ask you to join the 2% of readers who support this space.

Bettina Donmez E-Commerce Platform Development @ PUMA → Read the PUMA story We use Sanity to power a lot of content across our public website, including the docs and changelog. It works well from an engineering perspective: using the same source for both our public website and in-app updates means we maintain content consistency without duplicating work.

Emily Diamond SVP, Head of Product → Read the Morning Brew story Cursor.com is powered by a custom Sanity Studio, which allows our team to use agents to update every part of the site, defined in code. When we publish new content changes, we're able to see them live immediately, making it fast to iterate on webpages and blogs.

A good website has a clear purpose, and its form and function should reflect that. Structure your content so visitors can quickly find what they need—focus each page on a single message, and make sure your voice is consistent throughout. Encourage engagement on all devices. Use attractive layouts and ensure buttons and links are easy to use, so visitors can seamlessly explore and interact with your site on both desktop and mobile.
