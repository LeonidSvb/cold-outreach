    "homepage_content":"Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page: It works Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page It works! This is the default welcome page used to test the correct operation of the Apache2 server after installation on Ubuntu systems. It is based on the equivalent page on Debian, from which the Ubuntu Apache packaging is derived. If you can read this page, it means that the Apache HTTP server installed at this site is working properly. You should replace this file (located at \/var\/www\/html\/index.html ) before continuing to operate your HTTP server. If you are a normal user of this web site and don't know what this page is about, this probably means that the site is currently unavailable due to maintenance. If the problem persists, please contact the site's administrator. Configuration Overview Ubuntu's Apache2 default configuration is different from the upstream default configuration, and split into several files optimized for interaction with Ubuntu tools. The configuration system is fully documented in \/usr\/share\/doc\/apache2\/README.Debian.gz . Refer to this for the full documentation. Documentation for the web server itself can be found by accessing the manual if the apache2-doc package was installed on this server. The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Ubuntu systems is as follows: \/etc\/apache2\/ |-- apache2.conf | `-- ports.conf |-- mods-enabled | |-- *.load | `-- *.conf |-- conf-enabled | `-- *.conf |-- sites-enabled | `-- *.conf apache2.conf is the main configuration file. It puts the pieces together by including all remaining configuration files when starting up the web server. ports.conf is always included from the main configuration file. It is used to determine the listening ports for incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime. Configuration files in the mods-enabled\/ , conf-enabled\/ and sites-enabled\/ directories contain particular configuration snippets which manage modules, global configuration fragments, or virtual host configurations, respectively. They are activated by symlinking available configuration files from their respective *-available\/ counterparts. These should be managed by using our helpers a2enmod, a2dismod, a2ensite, a2dissite, and a2enconf, a2disconf . See their respective man pages for detailed information. The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of environment variables, in the default configuration, apache2 needs to be started\/stopped with \/etc\/init.d\/apache2 or apache2ctl . Calling \/usr\/bin\/apache2 directly will not work with the default configuration. Document Roots By default, Ubuntu does not allow access through the web browser to any file apart of those located in \/var\/www , public_html directories (when enabled) and \/usr\/share (for web applications). If your site is using a web document root located elsewhere (such as in \/srv ) you may need to whitelist your document root directory in \/etc\/apache2\/apache2.conf . The default Ubuntu document root is \/var\/www\/html . You can make your own virtual hosts under \/var\/www. This is different to previous releases which provides better security out of the box. Reporting Problems Please use the ubuntu-bug tool to report bugs in the Apache2 package with Ubuntu. However, check existing bug reports before reporting a new bug. Please report bugs specific to modules (such as PHP and others) to respective packages, not to the web server itself.",

You probably know casinos like Casumo , Leo Vegas and Jalla casino and many others, but did you know that they are founded by New Zealanders? Many of the most successful casinos in existence today are founded and run by Kiwis. For us casino players, a New Zealand casino means high delivery on both customer service and gaming experience. You can therefore feel safe when playing at a New Zealand online casino with New Zealand-language customer service available. Casinos from New Zealand also have a penchant for New Zealand game developers who rank best in the world on casino games. Read more and see our leaderboard where we have reviewed and listed New Zealand casino sites for you to find the right one! Play safely at casinos with New Zealand gaming license 2023 On January 1, 2019, New Zealand finally got a New Zealand gaming license after many years of political tours. This means that you as a casino player can trust that all casinos with a New Zealand gaming license now comply with the regulations. The regulations are developed by gamblingcommission.govt.nz, New Zealand's authority that deals with these types of issues. In connection with the new regulations, rogue players have been purged, which is very positive for the gaming industry. On Astoria.co.nz you will only find casinos with a New Zealand gaming license. If you want more information about what this means, you can read more here. SEE ALL UK CASINOS High security for casino players in New Zealand In general, all casinos with a New Zealand license are safe options to play at. The casino that has a license is under inspection by the New Zealand gambling authority and must meet a number of criteria in order to retain its license. Among other things, they must guarantee a very high level of security for their players and their transactions. New Zealand is generally far ahead in the field of IT security and the gaming industry is no exception. We were one of the first countries where online casinos broke through big. This means that there is a high level of competence at the New Zealand gambling companies when it comes to guaranteeing that players ' money and personal data do not end up in the wrong hands. If you want to check the security of a casino, they usually always indicate which certificates and which licenses they have on their website. In most cases, you will find it at the bottom of the home page or in an ”About Us”section. Other things to look at are whether they have a good customer service and what payment solutions are offered. Gambling is popular in New Zealand The New Zealanders are a gambling people. Every year, the Gambling Inspectorate and the measurement company Novus measure how gambling habits look in the country. In 2019, 60% of all Kiwis stated that they had played for money in the past year. Contrary to what you might think if you follow the media's reporting on gambling addiction and the like, however, these numbers are on the decline. Compared to the previous year, there were six percentage points fewer people who played for money, and compared to the first measurement made in 2013, there were a full thirteen percentage points fewer. However, it seems more common to have played for money last year than not to have done so. Men also play more than women. The games that are most popular when it comes to gambling are scratch cards, trotting and number games such as Keno from Svenska Spel . In terms of the entire market when it comes to gambling, casino and poker sites only account for a few percent of the total if we look at individual gaming opportunities.

Getting started and playing at an online casino has never been easier than today. Previously, you had to go through a lengthy registration process that in some cases even required you to submit documents to the casino to prove your identity. It is something that is no longer a requirement for New Zealand casinos. After the new New Zealand gambling act was introduced in 2019, casinos were also made more demanding that they must be able to verify their players. As a result, registration via BankID has become standard. In this way, the casino automatically receives all the information about you that they need, and the only thing you need is a password. Simply go to a casino site and click on the header that says something like ”start playing”. Then you will have to enter your Social Security number and then identify yourself by opening up your mobile BankID. Then you are ready to deposit money and start playing what you think is fun. When it comes to making transactions at casinos today, it is also a very simple process. The majority of all casinos offer quick and easy deposits with Trustly or Swish. If you use any of these methods, you will have money in your account within a few seconds and can withdraw it just as easily. Read more about slot machines & pokies online Slot machines or pokies as it is also known are the casino games that have become the most popular at all online casinos in recent times. No wonder, because the games are available wherever you are and on any device. Another reason for the popularity is that gambling on slot machines can generate jackpots of many millions! On Astoria.co.nz we love pokies and we have therefore collected and reviewed the absolute best right now. We are constantly updating the page with new slot machines. You can sort these through the search function on our game page. SEE ALL pokies Find the Las Vegas feeling at home with Live casino Many of US casino lovers have missed the luxurious casino feeling you can get from visiting a land-based casino when playing casino online. So when New Zealand game developers Evolution Gaming launched Live Casino where you could play table games like blackjack, roulette and baccarata against a real live dealer directly in Mobile, the success was a fact. We at CasinoAstoria think that playing Live casino is a great way to play casino. Live casino adds glamour to the nextcasino that has been missing.

We constantly update the list and also come with exclusive bonuses that we have negotiated with casino sites ourselves. Always look at our bonus page for the best casino bonus. VIEW ALL CASINO BONUSES New rules for casino bonuses With the introduction of the New Zealand gaming license in January 2019, there are some new rules regarding casino bonuses. The law regulates the bonuses in such a way that all players may only use one bonus per site. If you have already used the welcome bonus at a casino, you cannot use it at any of its sister casinos. The bonus may only be given on your first deposit, as a so-called Welcome Bonus. Some casinos offer other variants of bonuses without wagering requirements, such as cashback bonuses or rewards such as free spins or cashspin. It is still a small gray area whether these are allowed or not. # Casino Info Score Visit 1 Dunder Casino Bonus 200 $ Socket Smidiga Dunder Casino: Relaunch in New Zealand in 2021. Easy registration.

Entering information such as Social Security number, address and telephone number was only half the battle. In addition, you also needed to confirm this information by, for example, submitting a picture of ID or address verification. Today, many of these laborious aspects have disappeared. Now you log in directly with your mobile BankID and manage your deposits with Trustly. You can start playing in less than a minute. Casinos without registration normally have the same or similar range of games as their competitors, i.e. odds, pokies and table games and have proven to be a winning concept in the industry. SEE OUR LIST OF CASINOS WITHOUT REGISTRATION HERE Fast withdrawals are important for New Zealand casino players The fact that a New Zealand online casino offers fast withdrawals may for many players be the reason why they choose to play there. There have been countless investigations since the New Zealand gambling regulation came into force and they all speak their clear language – that fast payment methods and fast withdrawals have become as important as the casino bonus used to be. The fastest payment solutions when you are looking for casinos with fast withdrawals , are Trustly, Zimpler or Swish, but even some online wallets count as relatively fast. In that case, Neteller and Skrill are the most common and most prevalent at New Zealand casinos. We have of course collected all New Zealand casinos with fast payment options. # Casino Info Score Visit 1 Dunder Casino Bonus 200 $ Socket Smidiga Dunder Casino: Relaunch in New Zealand in 2021.

Tax-free profits If you, as a New Zealand player, want to enjoy tax-free winnings, you should choose a casino that holds a New Zealand gaming license from the New Zealand gambling Inspectorate. All online casinos licensed by the New Zealand gambling authority offer tax-free winnings to New Zealand players. Moreover, New Zealand casinos are the safest option for anyone who plays from New Zealand. Even casinos with a license from the EU give you the right to winnings that do not need to be taxed as an income. New Zealand's gambling authority charges 18% in tax from the casinos they license, which makes it possible for you to enjoy tax-free profits. The winnings never need to be taxed, no matter how much money you win. If you make a profit from a casino outside the EU, you must include your winnings in your income tax return. This also applies to winnings you make at land-based casinos in, for example, the United States. Your best option to avoid inconvenience is to play at one or more casinos that have a license from the New Zealand gambling authority. If you play at a casino licensed elsewhere, there is a high risk that you will not receive your winnings. When you play at a New Zealand casino, you can both get your winnings quickly and also avoid paying taxes on them. Therefore, svenska casino is the best choice for New Zealand players.

No wait for a table & little wait for our Kai to start coming. I loved that we could quickly scan & order and that the online menu had photos of the dishes & was available in English. We ordered 8 different dishes which cost in excess of eighty dollars. Service was efficient & friendly. Our table was clean & the restaurant was also clean. Phil N Unfortunately did not have the best experience, waited a long time for each meal to arrive. Each meal took about 15mins, it wasn’t a busy night but there were a couple of big families which could have caused the delay. By the time the next meal came our food became cold or we finished it because we were so hungry. Some dishes were tasty but definitely overpriced for the portion size. We ordered the sweet and sour pork regular $22 - as shown in the pictures, the bowl was bigger than the portion of food. It was tasty but so disappointing. Very deceiving!!! The spicy chicken had more chilli than chicken pieces and only skin parts. Again very small portion for the cost. The crab fried rice was $36 as you can tell from the image the bowl is deceiving. Maybe enough for 2 people. The dimsum was not as tasty as the other spots we have been too! Must say the sweet and sour was very nice. Other meals were average and pricey. Highly recommend the sweet sour and get the larger size even if it’s just 2 people. You’ll probably get about 8 good 8 good pieces with the regular 😂 Guttered we didn’t enjoy it because it’s so close to home and we’re hoping to make it our regular dimsum spot but maybe another time might be better experience? Nirmatha Arul (Travel Acc) Peking duck here is very nice very thin wrap also the lettuce second course is one of the best i ever tasted. it has perfect amount of flavors with no weird smell and the size of the meat and vege is perfect. Hyesun lee The front desk clerk with glasses was extremely rude, speaking loudly to customers and being impatient. I encountered this twice. She was also rude to other staff members, being loud and rude, glaring, lecturing them, and constantly nagging. Because of her, I won't be back. It was intimidating and unsettling, even though I loved the food. Kiki Conveniently located with plenty of parking in the vicinty of the restaurant. Nice and clean, new, modern looking restaurant. Friendly staff. Most of the food we ordered was good, especially the sesame balls, coriander + shrimp dumplings. The prawn rice rolls however, had an unusual taste & the prawn at the ends of the rice rolls were cold.. fancy looking desserts at the counter area. Overall a good dine in experience.

They run a very good operation there. Seems that all fish is battered just before cooking and there Chinese food selection looks pretty good too. Probably the best Fish n Chips I have had in Palmerston North. Definitely recommend! I have reviewed the fish and chips from here before as they are amazing! So I have to share about their fish burgers too. They are so yummy... So much fish! And the buns are toasted! It's not drowned in tarter sauce, just enough to know its there. Incase you can't tell, I realllly like these burgers! Nice food, took a while to make however they were very busy both in shop and over the phone based on the amount of people that walked in after and collected. They had plenty of staff to try and cope.

The bigger your group, the more flavours you will be able to sample. Food is best enjoyed freshly made, so our dishes are brought to your table as they are being prepared, some are fast and some take a little longer. Don’t miss out on our delicious desserts and cheese selection. If you are feeling adventurous, try a chef’s selection! Your server will be happy to help. see menu Venue Gothenburg is located on the lower floor of the ANZ Centre on 17 Grantham Street. Our stunning dining room has an airy feel with floor to ceiling windows and an amazing view of the Waikato River banks. Our outdoor terrace is a calm spot in the centre of the city where you can enjoy tapas or a drink on a sunny day. Gothenburg is just as suited for casual meals as special occasions, after work drinks or a coffee on the terrace, so come and enjoy our beautiful location by the river. Functions Location Our restaurant is situated right in the middle of central Hamilton, but tucked away in a very quiet spot by the river. We are a popular destination for riders on the Te Awa River Trail and a nice stop on the way for visitors to the Hamilton Gardens. We are located right next to the Hamilton Museum and soon not far from the new Waikato Regional Theatre which is due to open in 2025. We are very proud to take part in what Hamilton offers to locals and visitors to the Waikato region. book a table Gift Vouchers What better way to celebrate someone’s birthday or achievement than with a bit of luxury?

Reviews We drove all over looking for this place based on the great reviews, and are so glad we did! We had the most delicious Panang curry takeout for dinner. The restaurant itself is very simple; just 6 very basic tables for 4 people each, plus a brisk carryout business. The service is friendly, our order was ready in 20 minutes tops, it was well-packed to go, and absolutely delicious. Highly recommend!.Â Winkumsmom; Tripadvisor 9 april 2017 Food was lovely and highly recommend. Thai food at it's best. Everyone found something they wanted to eat and all enjoyed their meals. Left satisfied and would go back again.Â Shannon L; Tripadvisor 29 March 2017 Fast, fresh and tasty, reasonable prices, exactly what a restaurant like this should be. Simon Britten; Google review April 9 2017 As a fairly regular visitor to Noodle Corner I have to say thanks for make such delicious food. I don't tend to divert from my favourites - pork dumplings, panang curry and pad thai but I do intend to explore the whole menu... eventually! Keep up the good work!

    "homepage_content":"PetBiLocal – My Blog Skip to content Home 26 Sep The Timeless Appeal of Shoes: More Than Just Footwear admin Business No Comments Shoes are far more than something we slip on our feet each morning. They tell stories about who we are, where we’re going, and how we choose to present ourselves to the world. From the earliest leather sandals worn thousands of years ago to today’s designer sneakers that double as status symbols, shoes have always played a vital role in culture, style, and self-expression. The Function and Evolution of Shoes At their core, shoes serve a practical purpose: to protect our feet from the ground, weather, and injury. But over the centuries, they’ve evolved into symbols of identity and markers of social status. In ancient Egypt, the wealthy wore elaborate sandals, while commoners often went barefoot. In medieval Europe, pointed shoes signified nobility. By the 20th century, shoes were a booming industry, blending fashion and function to keep up with rapidly changing lifestyles. Today, shoes are designed with incredible versatility. There are high-performance athletic sneakers engineered with advanced cushioning, sturdy boots crafted to withstand rugged terrains, and elegant heels designed to turn heads at formal events. The choices are endless, and for many people, picking the right pair is both an art and a personal statement. Shoes as an Expression of Style Few fashion items have as much power to transform an outfit as shoes. A simple change from sneakers to loafers, or flats to stilettos, can completely shift the tone of what you’re wearing. Sneakers : Once reserved for sports, sneakers are now a global fashion staple. They’ve crossed cultural lines, pairing as easily with jeans as with dresses or suits. Boots : From rugged hiking boots to sleek ankle boots, this category is versatile enough to work across seasons and styles. Sandals : The ultimate in warm-weather footwear, sandals balance comfort and breathability with casual flair. Heels : Love them or hate them, high heels remain iconic for their ability to elongate the legs and add sophistication to an outfit. Flats : Timeless and practical, flats offer everyday comfort without sacrificing polish. This adaptability makes shoes one of the most expressive accessories in anyone’s wardrobe. The Psychology of Shoes Interestingly, shoes can also reveal quite a bit about personality. Psychologists have noted that the type of shoes someone wears often correlates with aspects of their character or lifestyle. Well-kept, polished shoes : Suggest conscientiousness and attention to detail. Colorful, bold footwear : Often associated with openness and creativity. Worn-out, practical shoes : Reflect practicality and comfort-driven priorities. In many ways, the shoes we choose act as silent introductions before we’ve said a word. Comfort Meets Technology Modern footwear isn’t just about aesthetics. Comfort and performance are now just as important as style. Sports brands invest millions into research and development, creating shoes with shock absorption, breathable fabrics, and ergonomic designs that support long-term foot health. The rise of technology has also introduced smart shoes — footwear with built-in sensors that can track steps, monitor posture, and even connect with apps for fitness tracking. These innovations show just how far shoes have come from their humble beginnings as simple coverings. The Sustainability Shift In recent years, sustainability has become a central topic in fashion, and footwear is no exception. The production of shoes often requires significant resources, from leather tanning to synthetic materials. Many companies are now rethinking their processes, focusing on eco-friendly materials and ethical production methods. Brands are experimenting with recycled plastics, plant-based leathers, and biodegradable fabrics. Consumers, too, are becoming more mindful, looking for shoes that don’t just look good but also align with their values. This shift is not only reshaping the footwear industry but also encouraging shoppers to consider longevity over fast fashion — investing in shoes that last, rather than chasing disposable trends. Collecting Shoes: A Cultural Phenomenon For some, shoes are more than functional or fashionable — they’re collectibles. Sneaker culture, in particular, has exploded worldwide. Limited-edition releases from brands like Nike or Adidas often sell out in minutes, with resellers flipping them at multiples of the retail price. High-fashion brands also contribute to this culture with exclusive drops, collaborations, and statement designs. In many ways, shoes have become cultural currency, representing not just style but also belonging to a community of enthusiasts. The Role of Shoes in Everyday Life While celebrity collaborations and high-fashion designs grab headlines, most people value shoes for how they fit into their everyday lives. The right shoes can make commutes more bearable, workouts more effective, and social occasions more enjoyable. They can also provide confidence — there’s something powerful about stepping out in footwear that feels just right for the occasion. For parents, children’s shoes are a constant consideration as kids grow quickly and need supportive, durable pairs. For professionals, quality dress shoes or heels can play a role in how they are perceived in the workplace. For travelers, lightweight and versatile shoes can mean the difference between an easy trip and sore feet. Buying Shoes in the Digital Age The way we shop for shoes has also transformed. Online platforms have revolutionized accessibility, giving shoppers the ability to browse thousands of styles without leaving home. Detailed product images, size guides, and customer reviews have made it easier than ever to buy confidently online. Retailers like Styletread in Australia have thrived by offering a wide selection of brands, fast delivery, and flexible return options, showing just how much convenience matters to today’s shoppers. The rise of e-commerce has made finding the perfect pair of shoes a process that can take minutes, not hours spent at the mall. Why Shoes Will Always Matter At the end of the day, shoes are far more than objects we wear out of necessity. They are companions on life’s journey, quietly supporting us through milestones both big and small. The pair you wore to your first job interview, the sneakers that carried you through a marathon, or the heels you danced in at a wedding — shoes become part of our personal stories. Fashion trends will continue to evolve, technology will keep advancing, and sustainability will drive new innovations. Yet the essence of shoes — as protectors, statement-makers, and storytellers — will always remain. Final Thoughts Shoes are one of the few items in our lives that balance function and fashion so seamlessly. They carry the weight of our daily lives while offering endless opportunities for self-expression. Whether chosen for comfort, style, or symbolism, shoes remain a universal constant across cultures and generations. As we move into a future shaped by technology and sustainability, our footwear will continue to adapt while retaining its timeless significance. And for shoppers who want choice, convenience, and a touch of style, modern retailers make the process easier than ever — proof that the humble shoe still has plenty of steps left in its journey. 24 Apr The State of Insurance in Australia: Challenges, Trends, and Future Outlook admin Business No Comments Insurance plays a crucial role in Australia’s economy, providing financial protection to individuals, businesses, and communities against unforeseen risks. From home and car insurance to life and health coverage, the industry is a cornerstone of financial security. However, the sector faces significant challenges, including rising premiums, climate change impacts, regulatory changes, and technological disruptions. This article explores the current state of insurance in Australia, key trends shaping the industry, and what the future may hold. The Current Landscape of Insurance in Australia 1. Market Overview Australia’s insurance industry is one of the most developed in the Asia-Pacific region, with a market size exceeding $60 billion annually. The sector is dominated by major players such as: IAG (Insurance Australia Group) – Owners of brands like NRMA, CGU, and RACV. Suncorp – Includes AAMI, GIO, and Apia. QBE – A global insurer with a strong Australian presence. Allianz and Zurich – Major international insurers operating in Australia. The industry is divided into several key segments: General Insurance (home, car, travel) Life Insurance (income protection, death cover) Health Insurance (private health coverage) Specialty Insurance (cyber, business interruption) 2. Rising Premiums and Affordability Concerns One of the biggest challenges facing Australian consumers is the rising cost of insurance premiums. Several factors contribute to this trend: Increased Natural Disasters – Bushfires, floods, and cyclones have led to higher claims, forcing insurers to raise premiums. Inflation and Supply Chain Issues – Rising costs of repairs and replacements impact claims payouts. Reinsurance Costs – Australian insurers rely on global reinsurance markets, which have become more expensive due to global climate risks. A 2023 report by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) found that home insurance premiums rose by an average of 12% in the past year, with some high-risk areas seeing increases of over 50%. 3. Climate Change and Its Impact Australia is one of the most climate-vulnerable developed nations, with insurers paying out billions in claims due to extreme weather events. Key concerns include: Bushfire Risks – The 2019-2020 Black Summer fires cost insurers over $2.3 billion. Flooding – The 2022 Eastern Australia floods resulted in $5.6 billion in insured losses, making them the costliest disaster in Australian history. Cyclone Exposure – Northern Australia faces frequent cyclones, leading to higher premiums in regions like Queensland. Insurers are now reassessing risk models, with some refusing to cover high-risk properties or imposing steep excesses. The government has introduced schemes like Cyclone Reinsurance Pools to help stabilize premiums in disaster-prone areas. 4. Regulatory Changes and Consumer Protections The Australian insurance market is heavily regulated to ensure fairness and solvency. Recent regulatory developments include: The Financial Accountability Regime (FAR) – Strengthens accountability for insurers and executives. The Design and Distribution Obligations (DDO) – Requires insurers to ensure products meet consumer needs. The General Insurance Code of Practice – Sets standards for claims handling and transparency. Additionally, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) monitors pricing practices, particularly in home and car insurance, to prevent unfair pricing. Emerging Trends in the Insurance Sector 1. Digital Transformation and InsurTech Technology is reshaping how insurance is sold and managed in Australia. Key innovations include: AI and Machine Learning – Used for risk assessment, fraud detection, and personalized pricing. Telematics in Car Insurance – Usage-based policies (e.g., pay-as-you-drive) are growing in popularity. Digital Claims Processing – AI-driven chatbots and automated claims systems speed up payouts. Australian InsurTech startups like Cover Genius, Huddle Insurance, and Honey Insurance are disrupting traditional models with digital-first solutions. 2. Cyber Insurance Boom With the rise of cyberattacks, businesses are increasingly seeking cyber insurance. The market is expected to grow by 20% annually, driven by: Increased ransomware attacks. Regulatory requirements for data protection. SME demand for coverage against digital risks. 3. Shift Towards Parametric Insurance Unlike traditional insurance (which pays based on assessed losses), parametric insurance pays out when predefined triggers (e.g., flood levels) are met. This model is gaining traction for agriculture and disaster coverage, offering faster payouts. 4. Health Insurance Challenges Australia’s private health insurance sector is under pressure due to: Rising costs leading to younger people dropping coverage. Government reforms to make policies more affordable. Increased demand for mental health coverage post-pandemic. The Future of Insurance in Australia 1. Greater Focus on Prevention Insurers are investing in predictive analytics and IoT devices (e.g., water leak sensors, fire alarms) to prevent losses rather than just paying claims. 2. Sustainable and ESG-Linked Insurance Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors are becoming critical. Insurers are: Offering discounts for eco-friendly homes. Divesting from fossil fuel-related underwriting. Supporting climate resilience projects. 3. Potential for More Government Intervention As premiums rise, the government may step in with: Subsidies for high-risk areas. Mandatory coverage requirements (e.g., flood insurance). National disaster insurance schemes. To save on your premium with Everyday Insurance, use an Everyday insurance coupon to get a discount on your policy. 4. Customer-Centric Innovations Future trends include: On-demand insurance (e.g., temporary coverage for gadgets or travel). Personalized pricing based on real-time data. Blockchain for transparent claims processing. Conclusion The Australian insurance industry is at a crossroads, balancing rising risks with innovation. While climate change and affordability remain major challenges, digital transformation and new insurance models offer hope for a more resilient future. Consumers should stay informed, compare policies, and consider risk mitigation strategies to navigate this evolving landscape. As the market adapts, collaboration between insurers, regulators, and consumers will be key to ensuring that insurance remains accessible and effective in protecting Australians against an uncertain future. 20 Dec Discover Glassons: A Leading Fashion Destination admin Business No Comments Glassons , a well-known name in the fashion world, has become synonymous with trendy, affordable clothing and accessories.

Brosa had reportedly posted annual sales of over $50 million before it went into administration last week. In addition to its stock and intellectual property, which it will now own, Kogan will also provide support to Brosa’s customers. Founded in 2014, Brosa was able to build a following among high-end consumers. It offers a wide range of home goods, including three-seater white couch and vintage rugs. It was backed by venture capital firms which helped fund the marketing and brand building of Brosa. The valuation of Brosa increased by 49 percent in the past few months due to its solid trading performance. Due to the pandemic, the demand for home goods retailers started to decline. As a result, Brosa was placed in administration. Brosa is in a relatively mature online furniture market that includes similar reatilers such as LivingStyles . You can save at Livingstyles with a LivingStyles coupon . In its filings with the Australian Securities Exchange, online retailer Kogan noted that Brosa was valued at about $60 million. It had also experienced strong revenue growth during the previous financial year. The administrator of Brosa said that the company received over 30 expressions of interest. After considering the various bids, it was decided that the online retailer would purchase the business. It’s a small acquisition for the Kogan, which has a market capitalization of around $350 million. During the September quarter, its gross sales were $202.3 million, which was 38.8 percent lower than the previous year. The acquisition of Brosa was relatively low-risk for both parties. It also allows Kogan to expand their online furniture offerings. 17 Oct Retailers failing to reach their sales goals admin Business No Comments Most retailers failed to meet their sales targets during the first quarter of the year, and more than a third were uncertain if their businesses would survive the next 12 months. The latest Retail Radar report shows that almost half of New Zealand retailers failed to meet their sales targets in Q3. The retail sector was hit by the resurgence of Covid-19 and lockdown in Auckland, which caused sales to fall in August and September. A survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers revealed that almost half of retailers expected sales to fall in the run-up to Christmas. Many of them were also not sure if they would be able to survive another year. Due to government lockdowns and changes in the alert level, many retailers have experienced a significant impact on their operations. Many businesses are complaining about a change in rules that limit what they can sell on level 4. This is leaving them hurting and unable to offer their usual services. Retailers were facing various issues such as a lack of stock and the ability to make rent payments, said Michael Jacobson, head of retail at PricewaterhouseCoopers. Almost half of retailers expect to raise their prices in the next quarter. Retailers wanted the Government to pay them a financial payment for their rent, according to a survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers. According to Retail Radar, the number of retailers who are satisfied with the government’s handling of Covid-19 has plummeted. Almost 70 per cent of retailers were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the government’s response to the Covid-19 report, according to a survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers. Retail NZ asked for measures to help retailers in the next few months, such as establishing a clear date for the Auckland road map, issuing saliva testing for Covid-19 and relieving rent relief. The motion also called for a halt to measures that would increase costs, such as the minimum wage and a moratorium on further increases. Stores like Glassons have continued to perform well with strong sales during Covid. If you’re looking to save on the Glassons Sale , use a Glassons coupon with your purchase. 05 Apr Coronavirus induced closures hit retail admin Business No Comments Coronavirus has caused a lot of store closure around the country, some by force and some voluntarily. Places that had a higher risk of transferring the Corona Virus including restaurants, gyms and pubs were forced to shut down. Other stores have chosen to voluntarily shut down due a complete drop in the traffic to these stores. Those employees of these chains that have temporarily shut down versus going out of business have had to look for other means of an income such as the newstart allowance. Two major chains that have recently closed all it’s retail stores are Adairs and Kathmandu . Adairs announced that it would shut all it’s bricks and mortar stores for six weeks to ensure the safety of their customers and staff. Adairs’ New Zealand stores have already closed due to the level 4 restrictions. Kathmandu has also closed all its Australian and New Zealand stores which number 170. They also own Rip Curl stores of which they have closed all 100 of them. They have over 2000 staff in Australia and all will be told that they will be stood down without pay for 4 weeks. They will however be able to use their leave entitlements over this time. Shareholders will also be affected by the virus with a suspension of dividends. If you want to continue shopping at Adairs , visit their online store which is still open. Use an Adairs promo code with your purchase to get a great deal. 05 Nov The top things to see or do in New Zealand’s South Island admin Travel No Comments New Zealand is known as one of the most beautiful countries in the world and there is an amazing amount of sites to see all around the country.

Andrea Ramsay Overall really good. Plenty of flavour and some individual herb tastes can come through instead of it being so singular in taste. An easy choice to make when I am traveling past Te Atatu on the motorway. Hopped Zombie This is without doubt the best Authenic food in West Auckland - for takeaway, or for dining in. This is nothing short of wonderful food. Emmett King We really like this place. Food is very high quality and service was with a smile. They've looked after us well through my partners pregnancy, ensuring the food was ultra safe and also making recommendations. It was very quiet when we went but a lot of locals use this place for takeaway due to food quality. David Shaw Great restaurant out in Te Atatu. Taste is premium ð. Can be pricey but worth it! Somewhat generous servings. ENKI'S FUN TECHNO STUFF (EnkiTrillionaire) As a picky eater, trying somewhere new is always overwhelming. But Shahi Dawat has very quickly become our choice for a great Indian meal. The chicken tikka is by far my favourite, and one of the best in Auckland (I recently even had this meal at Cassia, and it was extremely average compared to Shahiâs). The only critique Iâd have about this place is that the naan bread could be improved (I have the garlic naan), but honestly, this place deserves a lot of praise. Well done. Dora Ioana Always good. Reasonably priced. They are happy to use coconut milk to make dishes vegan or dairy free. Lovely family business. We would love to see the veganizable options clearly labeled in the menu. Thank you! Melissa P I eat at Shahi Dawat regularly and they never fail to impress me. The curries, naans, service and speed are always great here. Support local and head to Shahi Dawat, DON'T waste your time going to Shamiana next door it really isn't worth it. They also offer a delivery service with paywave available at your door and are always very friendly. Sutty Sutcliffe Find Us Light Dark",

Emerging from the rubble of the Christchurch earthquakes, this once-temporary boozer has become a permanent part of the city’s drinking culture. It’s a courtyard bar where the beer is cold and sold in real pints while the burgers are hot and cooked fresh.

Regular upkeep can prevent minor issues from becoming costly repairs and extend the life of your waterproofed surfaces. Here’s how to properly maintain your waterproofed deck and roof: Regular Inspections Schedule routine inspections, ideally twice a year and after severe weather events. Look for signs such as cracks, peeling, blistering, or pooling water. Early detection of damage allows timely repairs before problems worsen. Clean the Surfaces Keep your deck and roof clean by removing leaves, dirt, moss, and other debris. These can trap moisture and degrade waterproofing materials. Use gentle cleaning methods recommended by waterproofing professionals to avoid damaging the protective layers. Check and Clear Drainage Systems Ensure gutters, downpipes, and drainage channels are free from blockages. Proper drainage prevents water buildup that can strain waterproof membranes and cause leaks. Repair Minor Damage Promptly Small cracks or worn areas in the waterproofing layer should be repaired immediately using appropriate sealants or coatings. Ignoring these can allow water to penetrate and damage underlying structures. Avoid Heavy Foot Traffic Limit foot traffic on your waterproofed roof and deck, especially when surfaces are wet or curing. Excessive weight or abrasion can weaken the waterproof membrane. Reapply Waterproofing Coatings as Needed Waterproofing materials degrade over time due to UV exposure and weathering. Depending on the product used, reapplication may be necessary every few years. Consult with your waterproofing provider for recommended schedules. Professional Maintenance with NZ Water Proofing Specialist For thorough inspections, maintenance advice, and professional repairs, rely on NZ Water Proofing Specialist . Their team understands New Zealand’s climate challenges and offers expert services to keep your waterproofing in top condition.

Regular inspections, cleaning, prompt repairs, and professional guidance ensure your waterproofing system continues to perform well for years.

These inspections provide valuable insights into the condition of a building, ensuring its safety, compliance with regulations, and long-term value. In this blog post, we’ll explore the importance of regular building inspections and how they can benefit property owners. We’ll also highlight how F Home Solutions can help you maintain your property’s integrity and value. Ensuring Safety Identifying Structural Issues: One of the primary purposes of regular building inspections is to identify structural issues that could pose safety hazards. Inspectors check for signs of foundation problems, cracks in walls, and other structural deficiencies that, if left unaddressed, could lead to significant damage or even collapse. Detecting Electrical and Plumbing Problems: Building inspections also cover electrical and plumbing systems. Faulty wiring, outdated electrical panels, and plumbing leaks can create serious safety risks, including fires, water damage, and mold growth. Regular inspections ensure these systems are functioning correctly and meet current safety standards. Preventing Health Hazards: Inspectors look for potential health hazards such as mold, asbestos, and lead paint. These substances can have severe health impacts, especially on children and the elderly. Identifying and mitigating these hazards during regular inspections helps protect the health and well-being of occupants. Preserving Property Value Maintaining Structural Integrity: A well-maintained building retains its structural integrity over time. Regular inspections help identify and address issues before they become major problems, ensuring the building remains in good condition. This proactive approach prevents costly repairs and preserves the property’s value. Enhancing Marketability: Properties that undergo regular inspections and maintenance are more attractive to potential buyers and tenants. A building with a documented history of inspections demonstrates to prospective buyers that the property has been well cared for, making it a more appealing investment. Avoiding Costly Repairs: Regular inspections can uncover minor issues before they escalate into significant problems requiring expensive repairs. Addressing small leaks, cracks, or electrical issues early on can save property owners a substantial amount of money in the long run. Ensuring Compliance Adhering to Local Building Codes: Building codes and regulations are in place to ensure the safety and integrity of structures. Regular inspections help property owners stay compliant with these codes, avoiding fines and legal issues. Inspectors are familiar with local regulations and can identify areas where the building may not meet current standards. Facilitating Insurance Claims: In the event of damage or disaster, having a record of regular inspections can facilitate insurance claims. Insurers are more likely to process claims smoothly if there is evidence that the property has been well maintained and inspected regularly.

By choosing the right machine and following our travel tips, you can ensure a pleasurable and satisfying experience no matter where you are. Creating a cozy and stimulating environment for your baby is one of the most enjoyable parts of preparing for their arrival. A baby mobile is a delightful addition to any nursery, providing visual stimulation and soothing sounds to help your little one drift off to sleep. But with so many options available, how do you choose the best baby mobile for your nursery? Here are some tips to guide you in making the perfect choice for your little one. 1. Consider the Design and Theme Match Your Nursery Theme: When choosing a baby mobile, consider the overall theme and design of your nursery. Whether you have a jungle-themed nursery or a minimalist, modern design, there’s a mobile to match. Selecting a mobile that complements your nursery decor creates a cohesive and visually appealing space. Versatile Designs: If you plan to use the mobile for multiple children or in different settings, opt for a versatile design with neutral colors and timeless patterns. This ensures the mobile can be easily integrated into any nursery theme in the future. 2. Focus on Developmental Benefits Visual Stimulation: Babies love to look at moving objects, and a mobile with high-contrast colors and patterns can help stimulate their visual development. Black and white designs are especially beneficial for newborns, as their vision is still developing. Cognitive Development: Choose a mobile with a variety of shapes, colors, and textures to engage your baby’s curiosity and promote cognitive development. Mobiles that allow you to change the hanging elements or adjust their positions can keep your baby interested as they grow. 3. Music and Sound Features Soothing Sounds: Many baby mobiles come with built-in music or sound features. Lullabies, classical music, and nature sounds can help soothe your baby to sleep. Look for mobiles with a variety of sound options to find what works best for your little one. Volume Control: Ensure the mobile has adjustable volume settings so you can control the sound level. This allows you to find the perfect balance between soothing and overstimulating. 4. Safety First Secure Attachment: Ensure the mobile can be securely attached to the crib or cot. A well-secured mobile reduces the risk of it falling into the crib and posing a hazard to your baby. Non-Toxic Materials: Choose a mobile made from non-toxic, baby-safe materials. This is particularly important if your baby is teething and may reach out to touch or chew on the mobile. Age-Appropriate Design: Some mobiles have small parts that could be a choking hazard for young babies. Ensure the mobile is age-appropriate and follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for safe use. 5. Ease of Use and Maintenance Easy to Clean: Babies can be messy, so choose a mobile that’s easy to clean. Removable and washable elements are a big plus, as they allow you to keep the mobile fresh and hygienic. Simple Operation: Look for a mobile that’s easy to operate, with intuitive controls for music, movement, and light settings. Some mobiles come with remote controls, making it convenient to adjust settings without disturbing your baby. 6. Consider Longevity Convertible Features: Some mobiles can be converted into other useful items, such as a nightlight or a projector, as your baby grows. These multi-functional designs provide longer use and better value for money. Durability: Choose a mobile made from high-quality materials that can withstand regular use. A durable mobile will last longer and can be used for future siblings or passed down to friends and family.

When renovating your bathroom or simply upgrading your mirror, an LED mirror is a fantastic choice that combines aesthetics with functionality. LED mirrors provide excellent lighting for grooming while adding a modern touch to your bathroom décor. Choosing the right LED mirror, however, involves considering several factors. Here’s a detailed guide to help you make the best choice. Understand the Basics of LED Mirrors Before diving into the selection process, it’s essential to understand what an LED mirror is. LED mirrors are equipped with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that surround the mirror or are embedded behind it. These mirrors provide clear, efficient lighting, which is perfect for tasks like shaving or applying makeup. Additionally, LED lights are known for their long lifespan and energy efficiency, making them a cost-effective choice. Size and Placement The size of the LED mirror you choose should be proportionate to your bathroom space and vanity. A large mirror can make a small bathroom feel bigger, while a mirror that is too small might not be very functional. Measure the area above your vanity where the mirror will be placed to ensure a perfect fit. Also, consider the mirror’s placement in relation to other elements like windows or doors to optimize the lighting and convenience. Shape and Style LED mirrors come in various shapes—rectangular, square, round, and more bespoke designs. The shape you choose should complement the overall design theme of your bathroom. For instance, a round or oval mirror tends to soften a bathroom that has lots of straight lines and angles, while a square or rectangular mirror might match a more modern or minimalist décor. Lighting and Features One of the most significant benefits of LED mirrors is the quality of light they provide. Decide whether you want cool or warm lighting. Cool lighting is great for tasks because it provides a bright, white light, while warm lighting creates a more inviting atmosphere. Additionally, some LED mirrors come with extra features such as touch sensors, anti-fog systems, and dimming capabilities. These features can enhance functionality and user experience but may also affect the price. Installation Requirements Check the installation requirements for the LED mirror . Some mirrors can be heavier than traditional mirrors and might require additional support. Ensure that your bathroom wall is capable of supporting the mirror’s weight. Also, consider the electrical requirements for connecting the LED lights. Hiring a professional for installation might be a good idea to ensure safety and functionality. Budget LED mirrors can vary significantly in price, depending on size, shape, features, and brand. Set a budget beforehand, but be prepared to invest a bit more for a mirror that offers quality lighting and durability. Remember, an LED mirror is not just a purchase; it’s an investment in the functionality and style of your bathroom. Reviews and Brand Reputation Finally, do your homework by reading product reviews and researching brands. Reviews can provide insights into the mirror’s performance and durability. Opting for a reputable brand can also ensure that you get a quality product with good customer support. Choosing the right LED mirror is about balancing functionality, style, and budget. By considering these factors, you can select a mirror that not only looks great but also enhances your daily grooming routine, making your bathroom a more inviting space. Whether you’re looking for high-tech features or simple elegance, there’s an LED mirror out there that’s perfect for your bathroom. While you probably take great care of your interiors and mow the lawn regularly, you may neglect to clean the exteriors of your property. This can make your home look dull and unappealing. A dirty roof can be the source of other problems such as moss and mold. The wrong pressure cleaning method can damage the shingles. The right soft wash cleaning can help you prevent such issues. Algae From painting your walls to mowing the lawn, you put a lot of time into making your home look its best. But a dirty roof can steal the spotlight from even the most stunning of homes. Often mistaken for mold or mildew, the black staining and streaks on roofs across the United States are actually algae, specifically gloeocapsa magma. This type of algae forms where there is moisture on roof surfaces, and our coastal and humid weather makes conditions ideal for it to grow. Lichen, moss and algae not only create unsightly stains on your roof, but they can also weaken the structure of your home and lead to leaks and other serious problems. A regular clean with a no pressure roof wash Wellington will eliminate these pesky invaders and help extend the life of your asphalt shingles. It’s important to spray all growths and allow them to dry fully before applying a second heavier application of the Bio-Shield solution. Dirt When it comes to your home’s exterior, there are many ways that you can improve its appearance. You can paint your house a new color, add some landscaping, and even mow the lawn a few times a month. However, one area that often gets overlooked is the roof. Without a clean roof, even the most stunning home can look dull. Dirt, mildew, and algae can leave behind stains that can diminish the overall appearance of your property. No-pressure roof cleaning is the safest and most effective way to remove these stains. This method uses plain water that is sometimes heated to 50-60 degrees for a more effective wash. PROS Instant and effective, Chemical-free, gutters can be washed out at the same time. CONS Slower process, complete fall arrest systems usually needed, noisy – more disruption to building occupants, higher pressure potentially exposes leaks. Mold The climate of Wellington makes it a great place for mold growth. Exposure to mold spores can trigger allergies, itchy eyes and skin, sneezing, and asthma attacks. These symptoms can become severe and even life-threatening in some cases. The attic space of a home often remains damp and dark for long periods, providing the perfect environment for the development of mold. A musty smell is one of the most common signs that a home is infested with mold. If a mold infestation is detected, it is recommended to contact a Wellington mould inspection service immediately. Preventing mold growth is the best way to protect your family and your property. This can be done by ensuring proper ventilation, addressing water leaks promptly, and using dehumidifiers. A regular cleaning of surfaces with a power washer, bleach or mildewcide is also helpful. In addition to these methods, it is important to regularly clean the gutters and downpipes of a home to remove any stagnant water that can encourage mold growth. Sun Damage From painting your home’s interior to mowing the lawn every week, you probably do a lot of work at your property in order to keep it looking its best. However, when it comes to the roof, many homeowners aren’t aware that the sun can cause serious damage. That black staining on your roof is actually algae (Gloeocapsa Magma). Our coastal and humid weather conditions are the perfect environment for its growth, which can eat away at your shingles. This not only affects the curb appeal of your home but also reduces its lifespan. Getting your shingles regularly cleaned helps to prevent broken and damaged shingles, which can lead to leaking and expensive repairs in the future. The best way to keep your shingles clean is by using the soft-wash method. This is an eco-friendly, effective alternative to scraping or applying biocide to the surface of your roof. Our professional cleaning will leave your shingles looking like new and extending their lifespan.",

The food is bursting with flavors, and the menu offers a great variety of authentic Indian dishes. The staff was friendly and attentive, ensuring we had everything we needed for a wonderful meal. The lamb curry and biryani were standout dishes, and I can’t wait to come back and try more. Highly recommended!” Evgeny K 01:06 17 Mar 24 Absolutely delicious meals. Lamb was so good, I wish I had gone for the full menu and not lunch size haha Brad Garrett 18:52 29 Apr 23 Really enjoy curry's from pocket full of spice. Most flavorsome curry's I've ever had. At first Seems Heavy on coriander but it balances out and works well after a couple of mouthfulls. I get lamb Roganjosh, they have Nice big chunks of Lamb and don't skimp on meat like some takeaways do. Highly recommend.I usually get extra hot. I'm very used to curry shops making it hard to get what I actually ask for, they assume I won't want extra hot 😂. Pocket full of spice has been great giving me what I ask for without too much questioning. Christian G. 03:57 01 Jul 18 I had Indian food at this place for the first time in my life a few months ago and it was really delicious. After trying a couple other Indian places through New Zealand I came back here last week. The customer service was exceptional both times and after I tried some other places now I have to say that they do the best Indian food I ever had here in New Zealand. Can highly recommend them!

Trusted by Thousands of Domain Buyers Hear what our customers had to say below. ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Honestly didn’t expect it to be this good Saw this recommended on a forum and didn’t expect much, but wow. The amount of data it shows is crazy for a free tool. I use it mostly to look for brandable names and cross-check SEO value. Already registered a couple. Definitely bookmarking this. Anonymous Purchased on 01\/03\/2025 ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Can’t believe this isn’t behind a paywall Honestly I’ve paid for similar tools that do less. This lets you search through expired domains and filter down by authority, keywords, backlink stuff, even what platform they’re being sold on. And it updates constantly. Feels like a cheat code tbh. Anonymous Purchased on 24\/03\/2025 ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Great for finding niche domains I run a few small affiliate sites and I’m always looking for expired domains with decent backlink profiles. ExpiredDomains saves me a ton of time. Filters are a bit overwhelming at first but once you figure it out, it’s so much faster than doing it manually. Found 3 great ones last week. Anonymous Purchased on 03\/04\/2025 ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Free and no login required, love that I hate tools that make you sign up before you can even try them. This one just works. I use it to find domains for client projects — it’s quick, gives Moz and Majestic scores, and some other custom data I’ve not seen elsewhere. Would happily pay for it, but glad I don’t have to! Anonymous Purchased on 19\/03\/2025 ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Takes a bit to get used to but super helpful Not the fanciest UI in the world, but the data is solid. It took me a bit of clicking around to learn how to get what I need, but once I did, it’s saved me hours. If you’re into SEO or domaining, this is a no-brainer.

Brisbane's Outdoor Adventures: Sunshine and Scenery Brisbane, the sun-soaked capital of Queensland, offers a bounty of outdoor experiences that take full advantage of its warm climate and stunning natural landscapes. From the sparkling waters of Moreton Bay to the lush greenery of the hinterland, Brisbane serves as a gateway to diverse adventures in the great outdoors. Whether you're seeking thrills, looking to connect with nature, or simply want to enjoy the city's scenic beauty, Brisbane has something for every outdoor enthusiast. Island Escapes and Water Sports Moreton Island, a short ferry ride from Brisbane, is a paradise for nature lovers and adventure seekers alike. The island is renowned for its crystal-clear waters, sandy beaches, and the iconic Tangalooma Wrecks, which offer some of the best snorkeling and diving experiences in Queensland. Visitors and Perth escorts can explore the underwater world teeming with marine life or engage in a range of water sports, from kayaking to stand-up paddleboarding. For those looking for a unique adventure, sandboarding down the towering dunes of the island provides an exhilarating experience. Moreton Island's natural beauty and array of activities make it an ideal destination for a day trip or a longer stay, offering a perfect blend of relaxation and adventure amidst stunning surroundings. Exploring Brisbane's Lush Parks and Gardens Brisbane is dotted with beautiful parks and gardens that provide serene escapes from the urban hustle. The Brisbane Botanic Gardens Mount Coot-tha is a highlight, featuring a collection of native and exotic plants, a tropical dome, and a Japanese garden. It's a place where visitors can enjoy leisurely walks, have a picnic, or simply sit and soak in the peaceful atmosphere. For those seeking more active pursuits, the nearby Mount Coot-tha Reserve offers hiking and mountain biking trails with panoramic views of the city at the summit. Similarly, the South Bank Parklands, with its riverside paths, lush gardens, and sandy beach, is a popular spot for both locals and visitors looking to enjoy the outdoors in the heart of the city. Wildlife Encounters and Hinterland Treks Just a short drive from Brisbane, the hinterland offers a wealth of outdoor experiences, from hiking in the dense rainforests to wildlife encounters. The D'Aguilar National Park, with its extensive network of walking trails, provides a serene setting for nature walks and bird watching, offering a chance to disconnect and immerse oneself in the tranquility of the natural world. For a unique wildlife experience, the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary allows visitors to get up close with Australia's native animals, including koalas, kangaroos, and wombats. It's an opportunity to learn about the country's unique fauna and the conservation efforts to protect these species. The hinterland also boasts charming mountain villages like Mount Tamborine, where visitors can explore local artisan shops, enjoy gourmet food, and partake in wine tasting, all set against the backdrop of stunning mountain scenery. Conclusion Brisbane's outdoor experiences showcase the city's diverse natural landscapes, from its idyllic islands and waterways to its lush parks and rugged hinterland. Whether you're drawn to the thrill of water sports, the serenity of nature walks, or the joy of wildlife encounters, Brisbane offers an array of adventures that celebrate the great outdoors. These experiences not only provide an escape from the everyday but also a deeper appreciation for the beauty and diversity of Queensland's capital.

Please visit cafecarriages.co.nz instead. Visiting Kumeu: Auckland’s Premiere Winemaking District For visitors to New Zealand’s affluent Kumeu district, there’s no shortage of things to both do and see. On this website, readers can discover the many attractions to be found in Kumeu, a quaint rural winemaking community located roughly 25 kilometres northwest of the city of Auckland. Vineyards and Wineries The residents of Kumeu are descended from settlers who originally migrated from Croatia’s Dalmatian Coast in the mid-19th century. They brought the art of winemaking with them from the old country. For this reason, Kumeu now enjoys a reputation for its excellent vineyards and top-notch wines. In fact, winemaking represents the primary industry in Kumeu and in the nearby settlements of Waimauku and Huapai as well. Several local wine labels are recognised internationally for their excellent Chardonnays, including Cooper’s Creek, Kumeu River and Solijans Estate Winery. Visitors to Kumeu can stop by and enjoy the district’s impressive range of boutique wineries, along with its many highly-rated cafes and restaurants. Other Activities Kumeu has much more to offer than just vineyards and wineries. For example, vacationers can also visit the Riverhead, New Zealand’s oldest riverside tavern (located just a short ferry ride away). They can also drop in at the nearby Hallertau Restaurant and enjoy a wide range of freshly-brewed craft beers. Anyone planning a trip to Kumeu should thoroughly familiarise themselves with this site, where they can read about all the district’s most popular attractions, along with its best-rated hotels and B&Bs.",

Over the past months, it has been come noticeable that following the 2016 Kaikōura Earthquake damage may have occurred in the early stages of the crayfish lifecycle. This is only being seen now due to crayfish reaching adulthood between 7-10 years and we are witnessing a generational gap, through reduced number of crayfish of legal size this season. ​ The Kaikōura community has the privilege of being kaitiaki of our Marine area, and we have a responsibility to ensure that we look after our precious taonga species. For this reason, we will not be hosting Crayfest Kaikōura 2025. ​ Crayfest Kaikōura strongly holds sustainability and abundance for future generations as a key value to our celebration. To do this, we need to allow our marine environment to have time to relax and breathe with undue pressure. We are working with Kaikōura Marine Guardians to continue to research and monitor the fishery and looking at ways as a community that can continue to ensure abundance within our fishery and for the event returning in coming years. ​ We apologise to many who were excited about this year’s event, and we encourage you to visit Kaikōura and take a well rest break and rejuvenate like our crayfish. We invite you to discover the magic of our region — a place that stirs curiosity at every turn. Slow down, take your time, surf, swim, hike, cycle and enjoy our hospitality, or simply tune into the rhythms of nature.

Held within hospitality businesses across Kaikōura, the aim of Crayfest is to make crayfish affordable, accessible and available to every taste and budget, while celebrating crayfish seasonality and to encourage sustainability through enjoying just a taste of crayfish, and sharing a cray amongst friends and family.

We are pleased that you have visited our web portal. Browse through our website and visit our restaurant. As someone who's spent only a month in NZ I gave Curry Pot a shot as I was missing Indian food. I tried the masala dosa and felt it was not only filling but also tasty. The tomato chutney was delicious and I couldn't help taking a second helping. A bit pricy overall but if you consider how rare it is to find masala dosa in NZ then it's definitely worth it. Will visit again. Satish Google Review I love this place. Right across the street from work and a great lunch special. I've tried a handful of the different curries and I would say that the Chicken Tikka Masala is so yummy. The dinner time Naan breads are pretty massive too. They usually come out cut into thirds to make it more manageable. The staff are friendly and always happy to see me. I'm always happy to see them cause it means I'm gonna eat good in a minute 😁 Dave M Google Review The Curry Pot team were amazing on Saturday night - helping to feed around 60 guests at my home. They came and looked at the venue prior, provided table cloths, bain maries, serving spoons and labels for the curries. And - unexpectedly, two staff stayed on to serve up before packing everything down again once the feeding frenzy was over. The curries themselves were top notch! They always are. My friends and family were really impressed with everything and I was delighted with the whole experience - they made my night!

Please visit cargobrewery.co.nz\/gantleys instead. Kiwi Vino; the Inimitable Wine of New Zealand According to popular perceptions, fine wine is typically associated with France, Italy and the US state of California. But many of the most highly-regarded wine labels today hail from the South Pacific island nation of New Zealand. This website is concerned entirely with the inimitable wine of New Zealand, where to find it, how to drink it, and why it has become so popular over the last two decades. Old Country Winemaking New Zealand boasts several distinct geographical regions known for their impressive vineyards and wineries. These include Northland, Auckland, Gisborne, Nelson, Marlborough and the Waitaki Valley. Winemaking in New Zealand began in earnest in the mid-20th century, with the arrival of settlers from Croatia’s lush Dalmatian Coast. They brought the art of the vine with them from the old country. Since then, local winemaking has flourished, thanks mainly to New Zealand’s unique maritime climate. What’s more, the country’s elongated north-to-south shape allows for considerable variation between its different winemaking regions. A Growth Industry New Zealand is internationally recognised for its excellent Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir wines, especially those from the fertile Marlborough region. Since the turn of the millennium, in fact, the country’s domestic winemaking industry has grown by an average of 17 per cent each year. This website provides a host of relevant facts and figures for anyone with interest in New Zealand’s thriving wine sector. And one doesn’t have to be a wine connoisseur to appreciate all the interesting articles written by people passionate about the subject presented herein. © 2025 Gantleys.co.nz. All Rights Reserved.",

The earliest inhabitants were the Kolis or sherfolk, which named the islands as Mumbai after a patron deity Mumba Devi. The sultan of Gujarat acquired much of these lands by the 14th Century but it fell to the Portuguese in 1534. The Portuguese later gave MumbaDevi (Bombay) to England as part of a dowry upon the marriage of Catherine of Braganza to Charles II. By the middle of the 17th Century, England held control over the seven islands. Not until the 18th Century following land reclamation were the seven islands joined together again. Bombay derives its unique character from its varied heritage and is still considered a patchwork quilt of Indian culture and faith. Modern Bombay or Mumbai, the nancial and commercial nucleus of India has always been a magnet city attracting the young & elderly, scholars, engineers, artists and entrepreneurs, administrators and the actors from across the length and breadth of the vast and magni cent country of India. Everyone of them in search of fame and fortunes, with their talent, skills and tradition have lent Bombay it’s unparalleled character. With it’s Islamic-Gothic architecture surrounded by modern day Skyscrapers, with temples and mosques, synagogues and churches standing beside ve star hotels & discotheques.

Wild Thyme Bar & Kitchen is the restaurant located in the SkyCity Queenstown Casino, which is one of the five New Zealand's land-based casinos operated by the SkyCity Casino brand. SkyCity Casino New Zealand knows not only good games, but also good food. Wild Thyme Bar & Kitchen offers a curated menu that could satisfy even the pickiest of eaters, and we can't wait to tell you more about this great restaurant. Location and Opening Hours Let's start with the location, because you can't enjoy a good meal if you can't find the restaurant. Wild Thyme Bar & Kitchen is situated in the same building as SkyCity Casino Queenstown. The address is Stratton House, 16-24 Beach Street, Queenstown 9300 (Level 2 for the restaurant). The opening hours depend on the day. From Wednesday to Sunday, the restaurant is open between 12 pm and 10 pm, serving lunch and dinner. On Tuesday, the restaurant is open from 11 am till late, serving their Snack menu. Wild Thyme Bar & Kitchen is closed on Monday. By contrast, SkyCity Casino in New Zealand is open every day between 12 pm and 12 am, with different opening hours on big holidays. If you're planning on going to the casino and grabbing a bite at Wild Thyme Bar & Kitchen, make sure you check the timetable and book a table accordingly, because it gets busy. Another thing to keep in mind is the Sky City casino age limit. You have to be 20 years old or older to enter and this applies to Wild Thyme Bar & Kitchen as well. Food at Wild Thyme Bar & Kitchen It's now time to get to the good part – the carefully curated menu of Wild Thyme Bar & Kitchen. There are three separate menus for the three different meals served during the day. Between Wednesday and Sunday, you can enjoy a nice lunch or dinner at the restaurant, while on Tuesday, you can try the Snack menu. Lunch is served between 12 pm and 4 pm. You can get a lunch loyalty card if you're a local! Some of the meals on the lunch menu overlap with those on the dinner menu, such as desserts and a few entrees, but there are others you can only order then. These include, but are not limited to, a mouthwatering SBLT Sandwich with juicy rump steak and a fresh Tandoori Chicken Wrap. We also recommend being a little bit adventurous and trying the Soup of the Day, which is only available at lunch and is different every day, made with fresh produce. Dinner is served between 6 pm and 10 pm, and the dinner menu offers just as delicious options. Some items that you can only order then are the Lamb Shank with creamy garlic mash and the Ginger Chicken Salad. You can also try their signature meals the Lamb Gambler dish or the Beef and Guinness (served at lunch and dinner). In terms of desserts, Wild Thyme Bar & Kitchen is famous for its Banoffee Pie and its fresh ice cream. You can also indulge in coffee and the Cake of the Day. If you visit on Tuesday, make sure you're there around 11 am to try the Snack menu. The highlight of the menu is the flatbread pizzas that you can combine with appetizers such as Poutine and their famous Kumari Fries. Drinks at Wild Thyme Bar & Kitchen Wild Thyme Bar & Kitchen has a drinks menu to make your day or evening unforgettable. You can find all types of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks there. Wild Thyme Bar & Kitchen offers a wide variety of hot drinks like tea and every coffee drink. There are also more than a few brands available for every type of alcohol (e.g., rum, vodka, bourbon). The wine list is extensive, which is to be expected since New Zealand is among the largest producers of wine. We recommend wines from Marlborough and Central Otago (whether whites or reds) if you want to experience the richness of local New Zealand wine. If you're more of a beer person, Wild Thyme Bar & Kitchen has a rich selection of bottled and canned beer such as the popular Corona and Stella Artois and some craft beers like Emersons Orange Roughy and Panhead Quickchange. For some authentic New Zealand experience, try the Steinlager draft beer. Naturally, the bar also serves cocktails. You can discover the most popular mixes, along with some signature cocktails there. We recommend trying the Lucky Lychee if you're feeling like having something new; the cocktail is marketed as \"an alcoholic sorbet\" mixing two types of alcohol and fresh fruits. Thoughts Overall, we recommend Wild Thyme Bar & Kitchen. It has a lovely rustic, yet modern interior, fantastic atmosphere, and it prides itself on using fresh local produce. All these things explain why it's such a hot spot in Queensland, favoured by locals and tourists alike. What do you think of Wild Thyme Bar & Kitchen? Have you visited it before or are you planning to? Let us know! Oliver July 27, 2023 July 27, 2023 Read More After a long and hearty meal, you will probably be in the mood for some drinks. Sure, you will most likely be able to order one at the restaurant you’re in, but if you want to explore new places, we recommend you pay attention to the bars we discuss in this article. Queenstown has become a mecca for mixologists around the country and they can always cook up something you haven’t tasted before, so go ahead and check their creations. Here are the bars in today’s article: Habana Boutique Rum Bar Bar 1876 Queenstown Ice Bar Reds Bar Bardeaux The Sundeck Habana Boutique Rum Bar The Habana Boutique Rum Bar is a lovely Cuban bar that offers amazing music and the biggest selections of rums you can find in Queenstown. It differs from the more noisy and crowded bars in the area and it offers a hearty and cosy atmosphere amidst the craziness of downtown bars. Drinks you can try : Cuban Traditional Mojito (the absolute best in town) Address : 3 Searle Lane, Queenstown 9300 Opening Hours : 7 pm – 4 am Bar 1876 1876 is a bar in restaurant situated in an old courthouse, which already wins its points for a unique concept and incredible décor. The venue is quite big and it has indoor and outdoor seating, the latter of which gets filled up rather quickly on a sunny day. 1876 is very popular with locals and it’s one of the cheapest bars in Queensland with incredible happy hour deals, so if you want to go to a unique bar, but you’re also on a budget, 1876 is the place for you. Drinks you can try : Any of their many beers on tap Address : 45 Ballarat Street, Queenstown, Central 9300 Opening Hours : Monday to Saturday 12 pm – 4 am, Sunday 12 pm – 12 am Queenstown Ice Bar For a truly memorable experience, visit Queenstown Ice Bar. You might have heard and even been to ice bars in the past, but Queenstown Ice Bar is in a league of its own. Not only does it offer amazing cocktails surrounded by big blocks of ice, it also features spectacular ice sculptures created by local artists on a regular basis. Relax on the soft furs over the ice block furniture, while enjoying a premium icy cocktail and feeling like a true Ice Queen or King. Drinks you can try : Any vodka cocktail; Queenstown Ice Bar recently partnered with Absolut Vodka, so they can mix you the best icy vodka cocktail you can imagine. Address : 35 Brecon Street, Queenstown 9300 Opening Hours : 3 pm – 9 pm Reds Bar Reds Bar promises their customers cheeky cocktails and fab food, and honestly, what more can you want? They also speak about old school meeting new school, which really got us interested in the first place. What they mean by this is that they take classic cocktails like the martini and twist them on their heads, so if you want to see your favourite cocktail in a new light, go ahead and visit Reds Bar in Queenstown. Drinks you can try : Oldest Old Fashioned, which comes with some of the best 10 years old whiskey in town. Address : 30 Brunswick Street, Queenstown 9300 Opening Hours : 4 pm – 10 pm Bardeaux Bardeaux is an exclusive bar, hidden away in the bar area of Queenstown. It offers you an exclusive drinking experience amidst its dim-lighting, crackling fireplace and lovely music. It’s quite a fancy affair for those of you who are into that. It goes without saying that Bardeaux has some of the best, if not the best, selections of wine in the whole of Queenstown, so if you’re particularly into wine, you should definitely pay it a visit. You will discover some particularly rare finds in their cellar as they boast of their selection of vintage wines. Drinks you can try : A glass of any vintage wine they have in the cellar Address : Eureka Arcade off The Mall, Queenstown 9300 Opening Hours : 5 pm – 1 am The Sundeck The name really reveals it; the Sundeck is a big bar located on a rooftop and that’s probably enough information for you to pack your friends and take them there immediately, after all everyone likes a good rooftop bar and the Sundeck has a spectacular view of the lake and mountains. That’s not the only reason why this bar is constantly full though. They promise that the champagne is always flowing and that cocktails are always shaking. Enjoy a nice drink next to the fire (yes, they have fireplaces as well, they have everything). Drinks you can try : Jack and Rose; the Titanic couple might have had a tragic ending, but yours won’t be if you try out this Jack Daniels and Rosemary blueberry syrup drink. Address : Top Floor, 4 The Mal, Queenstown 9300 Opening Hours : 3 pm – 12 am Oliver January 10, 2023 July 27, 2023 Read More You are in the beautiful country of New Zealand and after a long day of adventures, you naturally want to quench your thirst and fill your belly with local delicious food and what’s more local than seafood? You should definitely try the seafood that Queenstown has to offer, because the town prides itself on its trendy restaurants and their fresh fish and seafood. We compiled a short list of the best seafood restaurants in Queenstown based on our own experiences, along with that of Internet users who have given overwhelmingly positive reviews to these venues. Without further ado, here are the best seafood restaurants in Queenstown: Blue Kanu Sukiyaki & Shabu Shabu Pier Queenstown Finz Seafood and Grill Queenstown Erik’s Fish and Chips Blue Kanu Blue Kanu is one of the most exclusive seafood restaurants in Queenstown, and although the price tag is quite high, we believe it is worth checking out, because the experience is definitely worth it. Blue Kanu has a very interesting choice of cuisine, a sort of fusion one, that combines Asian and Pacific cuisine to create a style that they call “Polynasia”. The owners says that they are trying to create a new type of soul food that has not been seen in the region before. They promise an exquisite dining experience, especially if you book one of their Koru tables that come with that VIP treatment. Some meals you can try : Trust the Wok – if you say “feed me”, the chef will do just that and surprise you with delicious things. For the more adventurous out there. Address : 16 Church Street, Queenstown 9300 Opening hours : Monday to Sunday 5pm – till late Sukiyaki & Shabu Shabu Sukiyaki & Shabu Shabu is a Japanese hot pot restaurant, which is sure to make you drool when you first come in. In fact, Sukiyaki & Shabu Shabu is the first hot pot restaurant in the region and as such it is always quite busy, so make sure you get your booking on time or you might not get some of that delicious shabu shabu. Although this restaurant offers all sort of foods, including its top-notch Rib Eye steaks, it’s especially popular for its fresh seafood, so give it a go. Some meals you can try: Crayfish is the bomb Address : 45 Beach Street, Queenstown, 9300 Opening hours : Every day 5:30 pm – 10 pm Pier Queenstown Of course, when you have the word “Pier” in your name, it’s almost a given that you’d serve some of the best seafood in town. This is certainly the case for Pier Queenstown, which has such a wide selection of fish and seafood that it almost deserves its own article. The restaurant is situated on the pier (what a shock, right?) and it has such a cozy atmosphere that you’ll want to return again and again until you finally try everything off the menu. Some meals you can try : Seafood chowder; it has mussels, blue cod, salmon, clams, prawns and bacon, which already make it a lot better than your regular clam chowder. Address : Steamer Wharf, Beach Street, Queenstown 9300 Opening hours : Every day 9 am – 10:30 pm Finz Seafood and Grill Queenstown Finz Seafood and Grill Queenstown is another lovely restaurant on the pier that specialises, as you guessed it, in locally sourced seafood. From what we’ve experienced by eating at this amazing restaurant is that the portions are massive, but even so, you always want that extra bite of exquisite fish cooked to perfection. Enjoy a big platter of every sea creature you can think of with your group of friends and down it with a couple of pints, bonus points if it’s local beer! Some meals you can try : Tempura Soft Shell Crab – this isn’t for anyone as soft shell crabs can feel weird to some, but you should definitely try the one they serve at Finz, because they mastered the recipe. Address : Ground Floor Front, Steamer Wharf Beach Street, Queenstown 9300 Opening hours : Every day 5 pm – 10 pm Erik’s Fish and Chips This one is pretty self-explanatory, Erik’s Fish and Chips serves fish and chips, some of the best in town! Of course, they don’t only serve that and you can find many other tasty things there such as oysters, mussels and prawns. What’s great about Erik’s Fish and Chips is that it’s not your casual fast-food place you can go to after a long night of drinking with your mates. No, the restaurant prides itself on its ingredients, all of which are sourced in New Zealand and not only support local fishermen and farmers, but also guarantee the fresh taste. Some meals you can try : Monk Fish and Chips – it’s super delicious and super fresh, what more can you want? Address : 13 Earl Street, Queenstown 9300 Opening hours : Every day 12 pm – 8:30 pm Oliver December 20, 2022 January 11, 2023 Read More Some restaurants provide you with the best food you can imagine, while others give you an atmosphere like no other; some do both and they are the topic of today’s article. We want to give you the most unique restaurants in Queenstown, New Zealand, that excel in both the culinary arts and in creative concepts and interiors. We hope this article helps you find the most Instagramable places to eat in Queenstown and that you leave with dining experience that you’re gonna talk about for years to come. Here are the restaurants we are going to discuss today: Sherwood The Bunker Nest Kitchen + Bar Fogo Brazilian BBQ Experience Tatsumi Sherwood Sherwood is a hotel and restaurant located in, as you can guess, in a spectacular forest overlooking Lake Willow. You will become one with nature not only because of the amazing view, but also because of the meals you can order there. The owners turned a destitute piece of land into a vegetable garden that grows different spices and vegetables, so you can always find something new on the menu each time you go there. The rest of the food like is sourced locally as well, so it’s always fresh. Dishes you can try : Sherwood duck sausage, cauliflower, blueberry, nasturtium (one of their larger plate options). NB: Many dishes are seasonal, so you might not find this one if you go there in a few months. Address : 554 Frankton Road, Queenstown 9300 Opening Hours : N\/A The Bunker For the fans of speakeasies, the Bunker is the place for you. You can find the restaurant on a small alley, hidden behind a big wooden door. Once you go there, you’ll see why it feels like Queenstown’s best-kept secret, as the owners advertise it. The cosy hidden away venue does not entirely rely on its interior or speakeasy nature; it’s also the home of top-class dishes served in the most intriguing way. Each plate is like a painting to the point where you might feel bad for eating it. While at the Bunker, you can also try their amazing signature cocktails. Dishes you can try : Smoked Canterbury ostrich; this is not your regular meal, but do try it if you’re feeling adventurous. Address : 14 Cow Lane, Queenstown 9300 Opening Hours : 5 pm – 11 pm Nest Kitchen + Bar For the best view in Queenstown, visit Nest Kitchen + Bar. It’s not the only restaurant on this list with breathtaking views, but it definitely beats the rest. “Nested” on a hill overlooking the lake, Nest Kitchen + Bar is a truly spectacular place whose massive windows will make you feel one with nature. In addition, it goes without saying that the food is just as spectacular. The restaurant offers modern takes on classic dishes, which is always a fun thing to try out. They have some interesting food options that you might not find elsewhere, so be prepared to try new things. Dishes you can try : First Light Wagyu Bavette Address : 139 Fernhill Road, Fernhill, Queenstown 9300 Opening Hours : 7 am – 11 am; 5 pm – 9 pm Fogo Brazilian BBQ Experience Fogo Brazilian BBQ Experience is well, really an experience. This type of restaurant can be found in other places as well, but we just had to include it on our list, because it’s a truly remarkable dining experience. What happens at this type of restaurant is that you can get the all-you-can-eat option, which has you sitting on your table while waiters continuously come at you with tasty meats, such as fillet mignon and lamb rump, and they cut you a piece, so you can try a variety of different dishes. We recommend you don’t have a big lunch, so you can get the most out of this deal. Dishes you can try : The all-you-can-eat option, duh. Address : 28 Ballarat Street, Queenstown 9300 Opening Hours : 5 pm – till late Tatsumi Tatsumi is a high-end Japanese restaurant in Queenstown that offers fine dining like no other. The dim lighting and the minimalistic interior contribute to the fancy dining experience that people crave. In terms of the food they serve, Tatsumi offers a new and interesting take on classic Japanese cuisine, so you won’t feel like you’re just in the next Japanese restaurant when you go there. They promise a fusion of “traditional flavours and contemporary cuisine” that will leave you asking for more. Their “trick” is that they combine Japanese flavours and cooking methods with European ones to create something new and memorable. The chef swears by this method, but we will let you be the judge of that. Dishes you can try : Oven Baked Oysters with Miso Hollandaise Sauce Address : 9 Beach Street, Queenstown 9300 Opening Hours : 5 pm – 9 pm Oliver November 14, 2022 January 11, 2023 Read More Hello dear reader and welcome to our new blog dedicated to the exploration of the best places to have a meal and a drink in Queenstown, New Zealand. We are excited about sharing our own experiences of the local restaurants and bars with you and we hope that you too will enjoy the places we recommend to you. Queenstown is a place of great natural beauty and it draws many tourists every year, which also turned it into one of the hot spots for the top chefs and mixologists in the country, so we felt like there need to be more blogs helping tourists find some lesser-known bars and restaurants that nonetheless have amazing food, drinks, and of course, atmosphere. In this blog, you will find personally curated articles that either have restaurant or bar recommendations. We will try to include everything for each taste! After having said that, we decided to dedicate our first post to our beautiful town of Queenstown. Learn more about its history and its biggest tourist attractions here. Queenstown Summarised Queenstown was settled by the Māori who believed that the lakes were dug up by the mythical hero and their ancestor Rākaihautū. The Māori gave the area the name Tāhuna, which means shallow bay in their language. In the 1860’s, William Gilbert Rees and Nicholas von Tunzelmann were the first European people to settle in the area and they soon brought more settlers with them, especially after finding gold. Tāhuna thus became a mining town and many English and Irish people settled the land and worked as miners. The name Queenstown was chosen by the European settlers in honour of an Irish town of the same name. It’s called Queenstown for Queen Victoria who was the monarch at the time. Later on, Queenstown massively rebranded and it is now a proper tourist town that offers lots of fun activities to people of all ages. This, however, made it quite attractive to investors, which significantly increased the prices of real estate in the region and it’s now the most expensive place to buy a house in New Zealand. Things to do in Queenstown Queenstown is one of the best places for winter sports in the southern hemisphere, so we recommend you visit it during the winter between June and September. You can go skiing and snowboarding and visit the Winter Pride festival (held each September) or the Winter Festival (June), where other winter sports enthusiasts will gather. In fact, Queenstown is quite popular for its various festivals around the year, which draw many people to the picturesque town. Apart from its two massive winter festivals, there are also the Bike Festival (March or April) and the Jazz Festival (October). Just beware that it’d be quite busy then, so you should book your holiday early. All in all, Queenstown is mostly famous and visited for its natural beauty, so you can explore the great lakes and mountains and engage in activities associated with them. You can also visit natural parks like the Kiwi Birdlife Park or Paradise where they filmed a lot of scenes for The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit film trilogies. Queenstown is also famous for its wide variety of activities such as snowboarding, whitewater rafting, mountain biking, bungy jumping, hiking, sky diving and paragliding, to name a few. It’s a place for the adventurous at heart, so even if you’re not experienced in any of them, you’ll be tempted to try them if you go there. Queenstown, despite its busy tourist population, can be quite peaceful as well. There are many secluded beaches and mountain hikes that will allow you to take in the scenery and truly enjoy yourself and nature. What we are trying to say is that there is something for everyone in Queenstown as long as you seek it. Enjoy your stay here!

Totally recommend this place. They also do takeaway and judging by the queue on our arrival, very popular with the locals. Definitely worth a try if you love Indian cuisine. Lew Bridger Nice food and great service. We will be back again, Thanks. Stu Best Indian. Ever. Nothing more needs to be said. Having said that, the site says my review is too short. Jaipur is, after years of searching, my absolute favourite Indian Restaurant. The staff are wonderful, the atmosphere good, without being over the top, and the food is simply magnificent. Colin P As with many other reviews on this site, we found the food superb. Also, when we all got a bit carried away ordering too much food the waiter stopped us and said – “hey, you’ve got enough, wait till later to order anything else, but I think you’ll be satisfied.” He was right. What brilliant service. Service was good, food excellent, good selection of bevvies. We will be back. 0",

    "homepage_content":"Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page: It works Apache2 Default Page It works! This is the default welcome page used to test the correct operation of the Apache2 server after installation on Ubuntu systems. It is based on the equivalent page on Debian, from which the Ubuntu Apache packaging is derived. If you can read this page, it means that the Apache HTTP server installed at this site is working properly. You should replace this file (located at \/var\/www\/html\/index.html ) before continuing to operate your HTTP server. If you are a normal user of this web site and don't know what this page is about, this probably means that the site is currently unavailable due to maintenance. If the problem persists, please contact the site's administrator. Configuration Overview Ubuntu's Apache2 default configuration is different from the upstream default configuration, and split into several files optimized for interaction with Ubuntu tools. The configuration system is fully documented in \/usr\/share\/doc\/apache2\/README.Debian.gz . Refer to this for the full documentation. Documentation for the web server itself can be found by accessing the manual if the apache2-doc package was installed on this server. The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Ubuntu systems is as follows: \/etc\/apache2\/ |-- apache2.conf | `-- ports.conf |-- mods-enabled | |-- *.load | `-- *.conf |-- conf-enabled | `-- *.conf |-- sites-enabled | `-- *.conf apache2.conf is the main configuration file. It puts the pieces together by including all remaining configuration files when starting up the web server. ports.conf is always included from the main configuration file. It is used to determine the listening ports for incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime. Configuration files in the mods-enabled\/ , conf-enabled\/ and sites-enabled\/ directories contain particular configuration snippets which manage modules, global configuration fragments, or virtual host configurations, respectively. They are activated by symlinking available configuration files from their respective *-available\/ counterparts. These should be managed by using our helpers a2enmod, a2dismod, a2ensite, a2dissite, and a2enconf, a2disconf . See their respective man pages for detailed information. The binary is called apache2 and is managed using systemd, so to start\/stop the service use systemctl start apache2 and systemctl stop apache2 , and use systemctl status apache2 and journalctl -u apache2 to check status. system and apache2ctl can also be used for service management if desired. Calling \/usr\/bin\/apache2 directly will not work with the default configuration. Document Roots By default, Ubuntu does not allow access through the web browser to any file outside of those located in \/var\/www , public_html directories (when enabled) and \/usr\/share (for web applications). If your site is using a web document root located elsewhere (such as in \/srv ) you may need to whitelist your document root directory in \/etc\/apache2\/apache2.conf . The default Ubuntu document root is \/var\/www\/html . You can make your own virtual hosts under \/var\/www. Reporting Problems Please use the ubuntu-bug tool to report bugs in the Apache2 package with Ubuntu. However, check existing bug reports before reporting a new bug. Please report bugs specific to modules (such as PHP and others) to their respective packages, not to the web server itself.",

After McDonald’s, Irish pubs are the largest export of food and drink in the world. It is not just the food and drink that they export, though. They sell the drinking culture entirely, although not as effectively as its home town, Dublin. The Irish are known internationally for their drinking habit. Every Irish pub in the world has almost the same aesthetic: dark wood panels running all over the floor, ceiling and walls, a string music soundtrack with bagpipes obviously, maybe a Gaelic sign here and there, a framed picture of James Joyce and Guinness running from a tap. The last bit of detail, the Guinness, was the actual reason why Irish pubs got sold so fast and so wide. However, it was not just because of the drink; it was because of the drinking habit. The Irish Pub Concept was developed by an architect from Dublin who went by the name of Mel McNally. He founded the Irish Pub Company in 1990 to expand the Irish pub business worldwide. He reasoned, logically and correctly, that the tourism to Ireland that had increased considerably during that time would make people want the Irish pub experience elsewhere as well. Right around that time, Diageo, the parent company of Guinness, got wind of this massive idea, and struck an unofficial partnership with them. Together, the two were unstoppable. The Irish loved Guinness, and the Irish Pub Company sold the drinking habit on the drink. Ever since their first Irish pub at Moscow airport (Shannon’s) they went on to build 2000 odd culturally and commercially successful pubs all over the world. It is, however, interesting to note that even though Guinness, which garnered so much attention because of the Irish Pub Company, was asked about it, they completely denied there was any formal relationship between the two companies. Bill Grantham, a visiting professor at Loughborough University , thinks otherwise. He went to explain that there were a lot of underlying clues that stated that Guinness and the Irish Pub Company are still working together, even though they openly deny it. The Irish Pub Concept belongs to the drinks conglomerate and parent company of Guinness, Diageo. The Irish Pub Concept even has an Overview section on its website where the market analysis of the Concept was being done by Guinness. The harp logo of Guinness is practically everywhere on the Irish Pub Concept website, and Grantham agrees that they have no intention of hiding this connection even though they deny it. McNally’s success formula for a good Irish pub were authentic design, authentic Irish food and beverage, Irish music and entertainment, and employees and management trained in the ways of the Irish. There is nothing like it, and is definitely a unique experience to try out. Ireland, on the 29th of March 2004, became the first country in the world to ban smoking in all workplaces, including bars and restaurants. People however, both local and international, were shocked to the fullest when the legislation included bars. The people who were opposing this move stated that it would be ludicrous to even assume that Irish bars, known globally for smoking and drinking, were the last places on the planet where smoking should be banned. However, this was not met with massive uprising and revolt, but rather with acceptance. Within the next few months, seven states in the United States of America and 9 provinces in Canada went smoke free completely, which included bars and restaurants. Other countries that followed suit with the Irish model of smoke free legislation were New Zealand, Uganda, Norway, bhutan and Italy. All these countries banned smoking not just for the customers, but also the staff who worked at these workplaces too. Scotland and Sweden brought about a smoke free legislation in 2005, while it took Australia 2 more years, finally banning it in 2007. After Ireland’s bold decision, several countries have come up with legislation to prevent smoking and protect their citizens from the epidemic of passive smoke. Even though the legislation was met with welcome arms in workplaces like public transport, the cinema and work offices, the hospitality sector, the bars and restaurants, raised their voices against the smoke free legislation. Most of those who were opposing the move were bar owners and their representatives, and the same resistance was felt in the United States and Canada where bars were a social focal point in everyone’s lives. There was a rhetoric of gloom and dread that washed over the place. The protestors argued that the legislation was unnecessary, unworkable and unjustified, and that it was not the job of the publicans and staff to enforce the law on the customers. However what really happened was a completely different story. The people of Ireland, as it turns out, were extremely compliant. In fact, they were so compliant that six months after the legislation was passed a survey conducted by the Office of Tobacco Control , which included a total of twenty six thousand six hundred and twenty seven inspections, concluded that the compliance rate clocked in a whopping 94 percent. The government also set up a free phone compliance line to report any breaches in the legislation, which peaked at 1524 calls in the first month, and declined rapidly to 145 in the next month and so on. Only 11 out of the 700 odd bars faced legal action for failing to comply with the legislation. When you think of the Irish, the first two things that come to mind are men in kilts playing bagpipes and drunk Irish men. The Irish pub is sort of like a watering hole for the Irish where everyone meets and shares a drink or two. The general idea of an Irish Pub is dark wood paneling, a string music soundtrack with bagpipes obviously, maybe a Gaelic sign here and there, a framed picture of James Joyce and Guinness running from a tap. However, the last item on the list, the Guiness, wasn’t really an Irish thing till 1990. 1990 was the year a Dublin architect who went by the name of Mel McNally made the Irish Pub Company. It was a first of a kind company in Ireland, created to build Irish style drinking establishments all over the world. Diageo, parent company of Guinness, saw this as a golden opportunity and decided to partner up with them. Since their first Irish pub in the Moscow airport called Shannon’s, Guinness has been associated with the Irish people since then. However, it wasn’t just a mere coincidence that Guinness partnered with the Irish Pub Company. There were two other companies, Love Irish Pubs and Ol Irish Pubs Ltd. which were popular at the time as well. However, the people of Ireland fancied Guinness over other drinks which made the Irish Pub Company famous: the other companies barely stood a chance. They still operate within Ireland suite proficiently, with Love Irish Pubs website providing offers like sports memorabilia, musical instruments and whiskey jogs among other bar related stuff. However, quite a lot of Irish people and people who have lived in Dublin argue that the Guinness gets worse outside of Ireland. In fact, according to them, the quality of Guinness gets worse the further away the pub is from Ireland. Bill Barich, author of A Pint of Plain, says that bottled Guinness is much thicker than the on tap Guinness that you are served at an Irish pub in the United States or the United Kingdom. The main reason why these Irish pubs in other countries are not as good as the Irish pubs back home in Dublin is the same reason why people practically live in Irish pubs in Dublin: the social factor. Irish pubs are much more than just pubs for them, it is a place of social gathering where people get together to have a good time in the evening after a hard day’s work and celebrate life. However today, Irish pubs are more or less like any other sports bar, with 15 flat screen LED TVs and no longer a community center. All that remains today of an Irish bar is the wood panelling and the Guinness. If you want the true Irish pub experience, it is better to visit Ireland itself. Ireland is famous for two things: bagpipes and drinking. Every major city has at least a few Irish pubs. They exist all over the United States of America and in most metropolitan cities in the world, almost like a McDonald’s or Coca Cola. There are Irish pubs all over the place from Seamus McCaffey’s at Phoenix, Arizona to The Grand Khan Irish Pub at Ulan Bator, Mongolia. Some of the common features in Irish pubs are dark wood panels running around every inch of the place, a string music soundtrack with bagpipes obviously, maybe a Gaelic sign here and there, a framed picture of James Joyce and Guinness running from a tap. However, the Irish don’t exactly fancy Guinness they just want to drink. So this whole stereotyping of the Irish with Guiness is actually due to a partnership between the Irish Pub Company and Guiness. The Irish Pub company is a construction company that specializes in building Irish pubs all over the world. It was quite the clever partnership, because it provides the place with an Irish pub, with a lot of business to Guiness; establishing that the Irish in fact are one for Guiness. This ruled out competition like Ol Irish Pubs Ltd. and Love Irish Pubs; which is a shame because Love Irish Pubs offers sports memorabilia, musical instruments and whiskey jogs among other bar related stuff. The mastermind behind the Irish Pub Company was a Dublin architect by the name of Mel McNally. He started the Irish Pub Company in 1990 after studying the basic structural elements of bars in his hometown, assuming that the spike in tourism at that time in Ireland would increase the popularity of Irish style drinking establishments in other places as well. Guinness parent company Diageo, seeing the opportunity as the golden egg laying goose as it is, decided to partner with them to sell what they referred to as “The Irish Pub Concept”. Building their first Irish Pub in Moscow under the name Shannon’s, they went on to build at least 2000 pubs in Europe alone between 1992 and 1999. They kept expanding, reaching 53 countries, everywhere from Canada to Mexico to even Iraq. McNally listed the major ingredients of an Irish Pub as authentic design, authentic Irish food, authentic Irish beverages, Irish music and entertainment , and employees and management trained in the ways of the Irish. They are also compelled to employ Irish people as the staff to make the people feel like they are in Ireland. The Irish pubs that are open now are mostly just like McDonald’s, all the good stuff has just been siphoned off, leaving behind a skeleton of the experience. If you’re planning to visit Ireland for your next vacation, then you ought not to leave the land without digging into these traditional Irish foods that are prepared in its most authentic styles. From fish in the summer to lambs in springs and soups and stews in winter, their food options changes every other season. Make sure your appetite is well maintained when you visit Ireland, to try out some of the most delicious cuisine and recipes in the world. Shellfish When you visit Ireland outside summer, the chances of witnessing the sun is very slim. However, on the plus side, you will be exposed to the opportunity of trying various delicacies from the west coasts’ native oysters. The best season to try them is in September when you visit the Galway Oyster Festival that takes place in that month. When compared to the other sea creatures, shellfish is the one that stands on top of the list. The Dublin Bay Prawns , cockles and mussels also have their own festival in Howth. Colcannon and champ Potatoes are the staple vegetables in the Irish cuisine that has transformed their food choices and recipes from the 16th century. It is one of the staple crops that is grown in the regions and also adds to the list of foods and vegetables that are cheaper in the region. However, the potato harvests hit the light only in the 19th century, which is now a part of the staple meal in Ireland. Colcannon is a famous Irish dish that is a classic form of comforting mash potatoes. It includes Potatoes Cabbage or kale Cream or butter Spring onions Colcannnon and champ follow similarly recopies but with a lot of milk and butter. It tastes the best when it is topped with scrambled or fried eggs. Boxty Boxty is a short form of all the potato-based recipes that includes potato pancakes, potato bread and potato dumplings. It directly translates to ‘Poor house bread ‘in English. All these recipes make use of grated potato shavings or are mixed with mashed potato and fried to dumplings. This mixture is then added to pancake mix to convert it into a pancake or is also integrated into a bread mixture to baking a potato break. Boxty can be teamed with anything, and whatever you choose, it teams up well to form a great mixture. It is also a great combination with smoked salmon or eggs. Boiled Bacon and Cabbage Although boiled bacon, boiled potatoes and boiled cabbage might not sound appetizing on paper, it still is an excellent combination for the tastebuds. A mixture of these three is also a family favourite. Traditionally a back of the pork is cut into thin slices (sometimes even from the shoulders). The meat is soaked overnight depending on the amount of desalting require and is boiled along with cabbage for ten minutes. The best accompaniment for this recipe is silky parsley sauce that is also a homemade recipe in Irish households. Irish pub or bar is not just a destination where people drink and have fun, but it’s a distinctive culture in itself. Although the number of pubs in the Irish land is decreasing dramatically, considering the ban of smoking and other lifestyle changes, the tradition in itself remains a vital part of the Irish tradition . In this article, you will enlighten yourself about the Irish Pub culture and the etiquettes of these pub cultures. An introduction to the Irish pub culture The social aspect is one of the major attractions of the country’s pub culture. The rural areas of the country comprised of three primary sources of recreation: The church Football club Irish pubs for drinking Until recent years, people of the land rarely drank at home, as social culture and social life was a crucial part of their lifestyle. The pubs in Ireland are known for their welcoming ambience, atmosphere and the quality of alcohol they serve. The warmth and friendliness of these cultures have spread to the entire world. In today’s world, it is impossible to find a country that does not boast an Irish pub\/bar. Pint Drinking in Ireland If you visit and Irish pub or bar and order for a pint, then the bartender is either going to serve you with their finest black beer called the Guinness or a pint of stout. Murphys or Beamish are the most common names for these Stouts, and they’re much more frequent than the Guinness. While in England and other regions, you ask for a glass of beer, which is half a pint in Ireland. One of the essential tips served by professionals is that the drink can only be enjoyed after it settles till the end unless you want to look like a novice Guinness drinker if you did not allow for it to settle. If you wish to take the Guinness, then better to visit Ireland and taste it as they maintain their authenticity. Ordering a pint Unless you’re ordering food along with your drinks, the barmen generally expect you to pay after the drink is served and for him to be tipped after every drink or every round of drink, to stay on his right side. Also, Irish people are reluctant to people showing off, so probably keep it a little subtle. Pub culture experience in Irish pubs People in Ireland are not reluctant to chat with a stranger, and hence you can begin talking to the barman or the person right next to you. Slagging is also a vital part of their pub culture. This, in layman terms, means, making fun of someone which can turn out to be too hilarious. If you’re a victim, then remember the intention is only to have fun and nothing personal. If someone offers you a drink and you wish to decline, then say ‘Ah, no’, even if you’re dying to accept it. So, you may have to be offered the drink at least 3-4 times before buying. Strangely this is part of their drinking culture. The essence of adding Irish seasonings to the authentic Irish Recipes imparts the exact authentic taste of the land. Whether it’s a festive event or a family dinner, authentic Irish food, over a couple of pints brings the extra addition of Irish land to the table. The top recipes mentioned in this article, along with their authentic spice mixture, is what you need to celebrate your next St. Patrick’s day – the Irish style . If you wish to know more about the recipes, follow the article till the end. Bread Making It is no brainer that bread making is one of the most crucial parts of any traditional Irish home. The people of Ireland also believe that it is also a meaningful part of any of the Irish households. In ancient times, a traditional Irish cottage kitchen baked this Irish bread on a daily basis. This recipe followed a conventional process of baking on large Girdles or on massive kettles that were generally baked directly on the fire. One of the main ingredients for their seasoning was the caraway seed, which is still used in most parts of the world and majority in Ireland. It is a vegetal, spicy-green flavoured seed that is added to the bread. They’re added to provide a toothsome texture with the hint of savoury flavour. Vegetarian Irish Potato Stew According to the traditional Irish people, St. Patricks’ day is incomplete without serving the guests with a hot potato stew. In addition to the traditional stew, the potatoes are also one of the most significant additions to the traditional Irish foods. Potatoes were introduced to the land in the 1500s, and pretty soon, it became one of the main components of the country’s agricultural produce. A traditional Irish potato stew is known for its rich, creamy flavour which blends well with the minimal seasonings like salt and pepper. But did you also know that there goes a ton of other seasonings that adds to its rich flavours. Some of the most important ones include: Dill Thyme Parsley Fennel Seeds The nuttiness from the dill seeds and the herbal flavour from the thyme add to the creaminess and starchiness from the potatoes. This is also another excellent option for all the non-meat eaters. Beer mustard Any kind of meat in Irish is accompanied by good quality mustard, which is mostly in the homemade genre. The tangy flavoured spicy residue is the best combination with corned beef. The intensity of the flavours from mustard seeds, prepared from scratch elevates the density of the meant. Mustard is also otherwise called a poor man’s pepper. Since they’re grown in Ireland, it is highly affordable for the natives of the region. It can be used in dry form to preserve liquids like wine, fine ale. It is one of the most Irish versions of storing drinks. Ireland is famous for its pub and bar culture if not for their drinking addiction. While it is easy to order a drink and have a casual chat with your friends at the ambience, this simple task to comprise of some of the unspoken rules that nobody tells you about. If you wish to know what they are, then stick till the end of the article and find out for yourself! Buying a round This is one of the most important rules, but when not followed, can leave you with a wrong impression in the minds of the locals and the barmen. Since the entire crowd of Ireland is fun-loving and lovely, there is a good enough chance that you might sit with the locals for a drink or two. Whenever the group finishes their drink, each person goes up to the counter and orders for everyone. You should not miss your turn of ordering or buying everyone a drink, lest you should lose your new Irish friends that you just made. Also, another pro tip to add here is that the couples do not count as one. Since each one is having a drink, they ought to order. Patience is the key for Guinness The drink is poured in two different stages, and it needs to settle down ultimately, which takes about a minute or two. So, if you order a pint of this drink in the bar , then the barman will fill your glass until half full and move on to something else. Don’t gulp your drink but wait for him to return and complete the drink. Once finished filling your glass, please wait for a minute so that it amalgams with the first drink and then begin to savour it. Getting a bartender’s attention Irish pubs and bars are generally crowded considering the fun and alcohol friendly people that they are. Hence, you have to wait for a couple of minutes for the bartender to process your order. Get started from getting close to the barman as much as possible. If you still don’t get his attention, lift your pointing finger. Sticking money in the air to get his attention is the last thing you want to do, as it is considered disrespectful. Drinking isn’t a race In countries like North America, drinking and getting high is considered a race- especially among young teens. However, the opposite is followed in Irish pubs – it isn’t a race, and it is imperative to drink slowly. Social drinking is one of the critical skills that ought to be maintained in the place. Key Takeaway Irish pubs fall under the destination experience the most fun and excitement, but this can be experienced and enhanced if you follow the right etiquettes of the destination. These unspoken rules are the key to better your drinking experience. When in Ireland, be an Irish! Daily beverages might differ from one country to another. However, one of the most common options is coffee. Since people have become more health-conscious in the past two decades, many consumers have shifted to healthier alternatives like soy milk and fresh juice. Coffee is no more considered a healthy drink because caffeine is said to have side effects. With such disadvantages being spread, not everyone will be enthusiastic about switching back to coffee. But it is only small communities that have avoided coffee, while many others still love the taste of the crushed beans. Brewing a cup of coffee for the morning refreshment is still the idea millions of people stick to. Irish coffee is just another type of coffee that has alcohol mixed in it. People who think coffee and alcohol are unhealthy shouldn’t simply skip this article; you are likely to fall in love with coffee all over again. Irish coffee can be easily made using some coffee powder, whiskey, thick cream, and sugar. All these ingredients will contribute to better health. Let us look at some of the benefits of drinking Irish coffee . 1. Reduced Heart Diseases The risk of heart diseases can be reduced significantly by consuming Irish coffee regularly. Alcohol can also lend you a safer path in life when consumed in healthy amounts. General blood circulation and flow to the heart improve with the consumption of alcohol. A daily dose of Irish coffee will make your heart stronger, but you don’t necessarily have to take it every day because it can turn out to be addictive. Two or three a week can help you fight all heart-related risks. When you are taking Irish coffee, make sure not to consume more alcohol than is recommended for your weight and age. 2. Reduced Risk of Diabetes Type II diabetes can also be reduced by taking Irish coffee. This may come as a surprise to most readers because the drink primarily consists of sugar and cream. When you drink it in moderation, biological responses that can cause diabetes will be inhibited with an increase in the plasma levels. Diabetes can also arise from overeating, which can also be reduced by taking Irish coffee since it cuts your appetite. Taking Irish coffee on a semi-regular basis will surely help you stay away from the risks of type II diabetes. 3. Lesser Chances for a Stroke Stroke is one of the biggest health risks that can even lead to paralysis. Many people fear it because it can become debilitating as soon as one encounters it. If you enjoy a cup of Irish coffee, this health risk can be reduced. The arteries will be unblocked due to the impact of caffeine and alcohol. Reduced blood flow is one of the major reasons for artery blockage, which can be brought down to negligible levels by drinking this potent beverage made of caffeine and alcohol. It can have great effects on the body to reduce the risks of a stroke. In this guide, I will be talking about some Irish recipes that you should get in a pub or a bar. They are extremely delicious. The sweet island is a gorgeous country that has produced some of the most amazing cuisines in the world, and it is unquestionable. The delicacies have been unforgettable. Ireland is also famous for giving us a lot of delicious food. We have to forget the Americanised pub food , and we should try some Irish delicacies in some decent pubs in Ireland, as soon as possible. Well, since there are two vaccines in the works, we can expect life to get back to normal anytime soon. We should actually support the local pubs in Ireland, because they have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Anyway, in this guide, I will be listing out some delicious Irish food that you have to try in sound their most famous local pubs and bars. The Irish stew happens to be the stable of Irish cuisine, but it does not have a standard recipe. But, it definitely is a favourite of the Irish people. It dates back to the 1800s, and it was often made with meat of sheep, because of the economic importance of milk and wool. After wool and milk were harvested from the sheep, they would go to get slaughtered. The recipe of this stew makes use of root vegetables and some tender meat of mutton. You can consume this as an appetiser or a decent meal itself. I am sure you have heard of Shepard’s pie. I have had the vegetarian version of Shepard’s pie, but the real version has meat and vegetables in it. They make use of beef and some mashed potatoes with some seasoned vegetables. It is the ultimate comfort food. If you are going to stick to a traditional recipe, you should choose beef or lamb. Coddle is the next one that I would like to talk about. It is essentially a wonderfully comforting creamy broth-based concoction which is completely made of bacon, pork sausage, onion and potatoes. It can be consumed in a cup or a bowl. It is a great choice as a starter. It is an amazing choice if you are hungry on a Sunday afternoon in bed. You can just whip it up in a couple of minutes, or if you want to put more time into it, you can invest and concentrate and make a really delicious bowl in an hour. It is perfect to go with your favourite comedy. I am sure you have heard of soda bread. It is a very popular side dish which is also a traditional Irish bread which is made without the help of yeast.",

Many Kiwi gamblers enjoy this payment solution because it offers quick and secure transactions, making it simple to keep playing without interruption. In this guide, we will look at how to find the best online casino poli options in 2025, how Poli works, and why it might suit your gaming needs. We will also discuss how to deposit and withdraw with this method, what to expect in terms of bonuses, and the advantages and disadvantages of using Poli for online gambling. Whether you are new to gambling with Poli or have been using it for a while, this article will help you understand all the basics. How do we rate Poli online casinos When looking at different poli casinos, it is important to know which factors matter most. Below are some points we consider: Licensing and Security We always check for proper licensing from reputable authorities and look for SSL encryption. This helps ensure that your data stays protected at every step. Payment Processing Speed The best online casino poli New Zealand players can find will offer quick deposits and withdrawals. We look for fast transaction times so you can begin playing your favorite games in minutes. User-Friendly Website We believe an ideal poli casino should have an easy-to-navigate interface. Clear buttons and menus help avoid confusion, making the whole experience smoother. Fair Bonuses and Promotions A good casino poli site will provide fair promotions. We focus on wagering requirements, deposit match percentages, and any other special offers. Variety of Games Playing on poli casinos is enjoyable when there is a wide selection of games. We look for pokies, table games, live dealer features, and more from top software providers. Reliable Customer Support We check if the casino offers multiple ways to contact support, such as live chat, email, or phone. Prompt and helpful service is key to a positive experience. Local-Friendly Approach It is important that the site caters to New Zealand players. This includes offering NZD as a currency, convenient access to customer service, and local banking methods. Transparent Terms and Conditions Finally, we want to see clear rules about deposits, withdrawals, bonuses, and privacy. This promotes trust between you and the casino. By reviewing these points, you can narrow down your search and select an online casino with Poli that meets your expectations. How does Poli work in online casinos? Poli is essentially an online payment method that allows direct transfers from your bank account to a casino. Unlike a credit card transaction, Poli acts as an intermediary to facilitate the payment in a secure, streamlined manner. When you sign up at a poli online casino, you can deposit funds by choosing Poli from the cashier section and following the on-screen instructions. The key feature of gambling with Poli is that you do not need to create a separate e-wallet. Instead, Poli connects with your existing internet banking system. This is especially helpful for Kiwi players who prefer quick deposits without additional steps. New Zealand banks often support Poli, making it a smooth process. It has also been recognized in some other countries. For instance, Poli casino Netherlands sites may allow Dutch players to deposit in a similar manner, though this payment system is more popular in Australasia. In short, if you want to enjoy a user-friendly deposit method without dealing with complicated account setups, Poli can be a fantastic choice. How to deposit and withdraw with Poli How to Deposit 1 Create a Casino Account Choose your preferred poli casino online and sign up by completing the registration form. 2 Go to the Cashier Page Once logged in, open the casino’s cashier or banking section. Select Poli as your deposit method. 3 Enter Deposit Amount Decide how much you want to deposit. Check if the site meets your minimum deposit needs for Poli. 4 Pick Your Bank You will be prompted to select your bank from a list. If your bank is supported by Poli, you can proceed. 5 Confirm Details Log in to your internet banking and confirm the transaction. Poli will process it securely. 6 Start Playing Funds usually appear in your casino account within moments, letting you play right away How to Withdraw 1 Check the Casino Rules First, verify that withdrawals via Poli are allowed. While many online casino poli sites allow depositing, not all provide withdrawal options through Poli. 2 Go to the Withdrawal Section If Poli is listed, choose it and enter the amount you want to cash out. 3 Provide Necessary Details You may need to confirm your bank account information to ensure a smooth transaction. 4 Waiting Period Processing times can vary. Some poli online casinos handle withdrawals in a few hours, while others might take a day or two. 5 Funds in Your Bank Account Once approved, your money will appear directly in your bank balance. Advantages and disadvantages of Poli casinos Pros â Quick Deposits: A main advantage of playing at poli casinos is the fast transaction time. In most cases, you can deposit funds almost instantly. â No Extra Account Needed: There is no separate e-wallet or card you need to maintain. You simply use your bankâs internet banking service through Poli. â High Level of Security: Poli uses secure technology to ensure each transaction is safe. This offers peace of mind when making deposits. â Local Focus: Many New Zealand banks support Poli. This local focus can be a big plus for Kiwi players who want a direct deposit method. â Simplicity: If you are looking for an online casino with Poli, you will appreciate how easy the checkout process is. Cons â Availability of Withdrawals: Not every casino with Poli supports withdrawals via the same method. You might need to choose a different option for cashing out. â Limited Banks Supported: While Poli works with many major NZ banks, not every bank is included. Before you sign up for a poli card casino or other casino site, confirm your bank is supported. â Geographical Restrictions: Outside New Zealand and Australia, Poli is not as widely used. This could be an issue if you plan to play on international sites. Casino bonuses and promotions for Poli users Casinos often roll out special promotions to attract players who use certain payment methods. While you might not always find a bonus specifically labeled as “Poli deposit bonus,” many sites do allow players to claim a standard deposit match when using Poli. Keep an eye out for welcome bonuses, free spins, or cashback offers. Welcome Bonuses: These usually match a percentage of your first deposit. Since Poli deposits are quick, you can start using your extra funds almost immediately. Free Spins: Some casinos grant free spins on pokies when you deposit with Poli. This can help you explore new slots without risking too much of your own money. Reload Offers: Once you have joined a site, you might get regular bonuses. Reload bonuses give you a percentage match on your next deposit. Cashback Deals: Some poli casinos will refund a small portion of your losses. While not very common, it can be a handy way to boost your bankroll over time. Always read the terms and conditions when you see a promising deal. Key points include wagering requirements, maximum bet limits, and time restrictions. This ensures you do not face unwanted surprises later on. Alternatives to Poli in online casinos While gambling with Poli can be very convenient, it is not the only option. If you want a backup, here are a few alternatives to consider: Credit and Debit Cards: Visa and Mastercard are widely accepted at online casinos. They offer fast deposits, but you may face higher fees and slower withdrawals. E-Wallets: Options like Skrill, Neteller, or PayPal might be useful if you want a separate account for gaming. They are also popular for fast withdrawals. Prepaid Cards: If you are searching for a casino with paysafe, you can buy a Paysafecard voucher and redeem it online. This is ideal for people who want to manage their bankroll carefully without linking a bank account. Bank Transfers: Traditional bank transfers work, but processing times can be slower. This might still be an option if other methods are not available. By weighing these alternatives against a casino pay with Poli, you can figure out which payment solution meets your personal needs for speed, security, and convenience. Conclusion Choosing a casino online poli payment method can simplify your overall gaming experience. You get the benefit of instant deposits, heightened security, and no need to manage a separate e-wallet. Many New Zealand players value Poli’s connection to local banks, making it a strong choice in 2025. As you explore different poli online casinos, keep an eye out for bonuses, game variety, and a user-friendly platform. Ensure your bank is supported, and check whether withdrawals via Poli are possible. If you cannot withdraw using Poli, make sure to have a backup plan in place. Whether you are new to online casino poli or have used it before, it always pays to read the site’s terms and conditions carefully. That way, you can enjoy your games with peace of mind, focusing on fun and rewarding gameplay. FAQ Is it safe to use Poli in online casinos? Yes.

The food was very yummy although the oil did taste a bit old and the fried food was slightly soggy as it wasn't a busy day. The owners were very friendly :-) Overall still a great place and would return to again if I was in the area Carissa H The owners are very nice and friendly. The portions are pretty generous and the price is reasonable. Their roast taste amazing very well seasoned not too salty or too bland. Highly recommend trying.

Hear From Our Guests Real Stories, Real Smiles \"Great food and great location. This is a local favourite and quite busy most of the weekends. Love the vibe and the outdoor seating. Staff is friendly and helpful. I always go for the big breakfast when ordering.\" Asiri Dalugoda \"Wow!!!! I have just discovered this place, I wish I had known about it sooner..... The pasta was too die for, the fish was too die for, the cakes looked good but was too full. Plus they sell alcohol, so nice place for lunch. Friendly staff. You have to try this place, we'll worth the drive. I'll be back!.\" Candace Featherstone \"This place is an absolute gem, I recommend it to everyone. We have been many times and eaten most meals on the menu with the highlights being the beef Wellington and the Pork noodles. The food is simple but done perfectly every time. The service is always warm, friendly and very attentive. I cannot recommend highly enough. Kid-friendliness: Very kid friendly with a small outdoor playground to keep the littles entertained\" Louise Guernsey \"Wonderful staff, delicious fresh food. Can't beat the French toast, iced chocolate, or the carrot cake (don't leave without a takeaway of these scrumptiously moist temptations!) Clean and tidy, big covered outdoor area, and even a little outdoor playground for kids.\" Michelle Page Join Our Community Black Cottage Cafe is more than a cafe; it’s a community.

They are very nice, could not speak mandarin well instead they spoke a dialect. You can still understand them 80%. Food was good, big portion, and most of them are yum. Hi La soup was seasoned with tons of spices and made it undrinkable to me, but other customers seemed fine. It could be personal preference. Price is also reasonable. We will be back for more but not Hu La soup. Hao This Chinese restaurant is underrated. The location is by the shopping centre car-park, so it’s not visibly obvious from the main road. The food (particularly vegetable dishes) is exquisite. I recommend Eggs fried with tomatoes (西红柿炒鸡蛋), it’s a Chinese common dish, but it’s the best that I’ve tasted anywhere. I also recommend eggplant stir fried with beans. Nice atmosphere as well. They also do a typical northern Chinese breakfast in the morning. Johannes Dimyadi Instead of dining at the usual restaurants lining Dominion Rd, recently visited this eatery located in Eden Quarter with a group of friends on a Friday evening. The restaurant is not big, but has a nice ambience, clean and the service was quick and cheerful 😃. Among all the dishes we ordered, our favourites were Chicken with Fresh Chili (粒粒鸡), Lamb with Cumin (孜然羊肉) and in particular Three Brothers (地三鲜, a vegetarian dish with fried potato, eggplant and pepper in a garlicky savory sauce). 地三鲜 is a signature northern Chinese dish & its poetic name is roughly translated to “three treasures from the earth”. It is a very simply, family styled and rusty dish, but ohh man it is soo mouth-wateringly delicious 😋. Di Melody Huang One of the best place for the Chinese breakfast. Their noodles are really good plus good variety options. The price is very reasonable. I will recommend this place for everyone. Vincent H 紐西蘭吃喝玩樂 Vincent in New Zealand Used to have my traditional chinese breakfast here. Took an easy lunch today with my friend. Simply a Northern China family restaurant, demonstrating traditional chinese way of cooking skills and seasonings. Friendly price definitely value for the portion and the money you spend.

Everything was so tasty. I agree with the other reviewers that the chicken nibbles are one of a kind. Full of flavor. My partner and I also enjoyed the roast pork and the pork cracklings were to die for! The roast vegetables were also delicious. The chips were crispy and nicely seasoned with chicken salt. The 2 servers were also really nice in person and over the phone when I ordered. E S Reyes This is the only restaurant where we can get everything at a very reasonable price. Thank you so much for the great service! I’m a regular customer and always satisfied. Sunil Shrestha This shop serves the most delicious chicken nibbles, chips, and roast pork—always fresh, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. The environment is clean, pleasant, and inviting. Highly recommended! Ranjan Mainali Best food and excellent customer service. The staffs are super friendly and make you feel very welcome. Highly recommended! Shritika Shrestha The roast meals are always good especially the roast pork meal and that pork crackling is fire! The hot chips, fried chicken and chicken nibbles are some of the best in Auckland! Service is great too except sometimes a grumpy lady behind the counter who can't take a joke and also when they say the hot chips will take \"7 minutes\" but it takes double that!

I agree with the other reviewers that the chicken nibbles are one of a kind. Full of flavor. My partner and I also enjoyed the roast pork and the pork cracklings were to die for! The roast vegetables were also delicious. The chips were crispy and nicely seasoned with chicken salt. The 2 servers were also really nice in person and over the phone when I ordered. E S Reyes This is the only restaurant where we can get everything at a very reasonable price. Thank you so much for the great service! I’m a regular customer and always satisfied. Sunil Shrestha This shop serves the most delicious chicken nibbles, chips, and roast pork—always fresh, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. The environment is clean, pleasant, and inviting. Highly recommended! Ranjan Mainali Best food and excellent customer service. The staffs are super friendly and make you feel very welcome. Highly recommended! Shritika Shrestha The roast meals are always good especially the roast pork meal and that pork crackling is fire! The hot chips, fried chicken and chicken nibbles are some of the best in Auckland! Service is great too except sometimes a grumpy lady behind the counter who can't take a joke and also when they say the hot chips will take \"7 minutes\" but it takes double that!

    "homepage_content":"camelgrill Search Search for: camelgrill Exotic Mediterranean tastes… Menu Skip to content About Camel Grill Caravan Catering and Functions Contact us Open Search The birth of our little camel caravan.. Abdalla had been keeping an eye on second hand caravans for a little while, with the idea of creating something for markets and festivals that he could take with him, be able to cook on site and, in doing so, bring his favourite traditional dishes out to the street. Basically, a cafe on wheels. This was the vision! We are now in the fourth week of running the Camel Grill Caravan at a couple of weekend markets: Saturday Underground Market by Frank Kitts Park and Sunday at the farmers market by Waitangi Park, both in Wellington. We have both had some great feedback about how the caravan looks (a couple of private tours!), and it really makes both Abdalla and I think back to the months of hard work. I thought it might be fun to share a bit of our journey… The caravan came to us from Nelson, so after arranging passage on the ferry (Bluebridge were just lovely and easy to deal with) we waited excitedly on the other end to meet it as it drove into Wellington. It was fairly shabby-looking at this point, but Abdalla was keen to get it home and have a look over the frame and jump straight into whatever work was needed. The first big project was fixing the rust in the roof and under the caravan. It was mounted on jacks, wheels removed and Abdalla spend about a week on his back under the caravan sealing and repainting. I remember him coming home covered in paint, scratches and bruises to tell me that he had spent a good twenty minutes pinned under the caravan after one of the jacks was knocked over. He is a pretty resiliant Egyptian and used to the odd work injury in his profession, but really this is something a partner never really wants to hear! The entire roof was eventually replaced as the rust was beyond repair, and once this was done Abdalla started the long process of stripping out the interior. The interesting and exciting part was planning exactly how he wanted the inside of the caravan to function. We both spent a lot of time on TradeMe looking for parts and equipment (hanging in until the end of some fairly tense auctions!) that would eventually be installed. Anyone who has had experience with caravans will know that space is at a premium, and Abdalla had to plan pretty carefully how everything would fit… pretty cozy! Painting the exterior was one of the fun jobs. As an artist, I finally felt like I could really flex my painting muscle to help Abdalla bring the Camel Grill to life. We spent a long weekend priming and then spray painting a desert scene onto all four sides of the caravan. We were both so happy with the final result, even though I had completely lost the feeling in the tip of my index finger from the spray can. And finally from the middle of February until the end of July, after building, painting, wiring, plumbing, many broken drill bits and grinder injuries… and a certainly a few new skills that Abdalla picked up along the way… here we are! We would love you to come past and visit us if you are at the market… and maybe even offer a peek inside if you are interested! Shukran! August 16, 2015 0 Welcome to the Camel Grill Hello! The Camel Grill is a company set up by Abdalla Tammam to share his skills as a chef. We would love to take the chance to welcome you to our website and blog… and into our kitchen. Outside of running the business, we love to share time messing around in our kitchen at home (mainly me watching and playing Sous-Chef as Abdalla comes up with new ideas), and sharing food with family and friends. Abdalla is also available to cater functions, take cooking lesson at home, and visit markets and festivals with the Camel Grill caravan. There is a link in the menu above to contact details if you are interested to find out more! Shukran and enjoy!! July 15, 2015 0 Search for: Recent Posts The birth of our little camel caravan..

I remember him coming home covered in paint, scratches and bruises to tell me that he had spent a good twenty minutes pinned under the caravan after one of the jacks was knocked over. He is a pretty resiliant Egyptian and used to the odd work injury in his profession, but really this is something a partner never really wants to hear! The entire roof was eventually replaced as the rust was beyond repair, and once this was done Abdalla started the long process of stripping out the interior. The interesting and exciting part was planning exactly how he wanted the inside of the caravan to function. We both spent a lot of time on TradeMe looking for parts and equipment (hanging in until the end of some fairly tense auctions!) that would eventually be installed. Anyone who has had experience with caravans will know that space is at a premium, and Abdalla had to plan pretty carefully how everything would fit… pretty cozy! Painting the exterior was one of the fun jobs. As an artist, I finally felt like I could really flex my painting muscle to help Abdalla bring the Camel Grill to life. We spent a long weekend priming and then spray painting a desert scene onto all four sides of the caravan. We were both so happy with the final result, even though I had completely lost the feeling in the tip of my index finger from the spray can. And finally from the middle of February until the end of July, after building, painting, wiring, plumbing, many broken drill bits and grinder injuries… and a certainly a few new skills that Abdalla picked up along the way… here we are! We would love you to come past and visit us if you are at the market… and maybe even offer a peek inside if you are interested! Shukran! August 16, 2015 0 Welcome to the Camel Grill Hello! The Camel Grill is a company set up by Abdalla Tammam to share his skills as a chef. We would love to take the chance to welcome you to our website and blog… and into our kitchen. Outside of running the business, we love to share time messing around in our kitchen at home (mainly me watching and playing Sous-Chef as Abdalla comes up with new ideas), and sharing food with family and friends. Abdalla is also available to cater functions, take cooking lesson at home, and visit markets and festivals with the Camel Grill caravan. There is a link in the menu above to contact details if you are interested to find out more! Shukran and enjoy!! July 15, 2015 0 Search for: Recent Posts The birth of our little camel caravan..

You can tell he takes the time to make sure everything is evenly applied, not sloppily thrown together like at a large chain drive-thru. The value for money and service is fantastic. There’s also a nice area for customers to sit and eat, which is always clean and tidy, with a TV on. It’s a great spot for elderly customers who enjoy sitting down for lunch or an early dinner.

While the flavors were decent, the dishes left much to be desired. Both were overwhelmingly vegetable-heavy with very few pieces of chicken, which was disappointing. It felt like the portions reflected cost-cutting measures, prioritizing vegetables over protein. Overall, an okay meal. It was affordable. Elroy Okada My sister and I decided to try Fu Lin Kitchen on a whim, we arrived 30 minutes before closing time but the lovely woman let us order what we wanted and the food arrived promptly. I had the beef brisket on rice and cucumber salad, while my sisters had sweet and sour chicken on rice and lemon chicken on rice. We all thoroughly enjoyed our meals, including my two year old who shared my beef brisket on rice with me. Cooked to perfection. Would definitely come back here again. Helena Fonoti Filipo I decided to try a new restaurant last night but can home somewhat disappointed. I believe the NEW OWNERS should work a little more with the quality and taste of the food. Most came out tasteless. Our Dry Hor Fun had nothing but broken rice noodle bits. The Wonton soup didn't have much flavor and was pretty blend. This restaurant was was really good a year back... Michael Lachica August 2023\/ Now under new ownership, still very acceptable, Saturday lunch was steady with 3-4 tables. 1\/ Usually do takeout, but today, decided to do lunch, all very pleasant, away from the hustle and bustle of Westcity, but still just a pedestrian crossing away, most enjoyable. 2\/ Drop in for dinner, didn’t disappoint as per photo. 3\/ Saturday night dinner, steady patronage, a very nice enjoyable meal for two. 4\/ another visit for Saturday lunch, under new ownership, standards are still high. cee doubleyou There's a lot of under rated Chinese places around and this is one of them. Anyone saying this place is grubby and needs their plates replaced obviously haven't been to Asia. The place is tidy and neat and has a good food safety rating, that is all you need. Other than that you would come here for the food. Chef here is consistent, and the place is run by a family. Expect hearing Cantonese because hey, you're at a Chinese restaurant. And do expect good range of tofu, duck, seafood dishes. Lunch is very cheap! So suggest going here than your local takeaways. Very generous with their veges and the choice of fish is Hāpuka! The staff are friendly and always can recommend a good eat. Odyssey L PREV NEXT LOCATION × Average Customer Rating 4.2 I recently ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and Eggplant with Chicken. While the flavors were decent, the dishes left much to be desired. Both were overwhelmingly vegetable-heavy with very few pieces of chicken, which was disappointing. It felt like the portions reflected cost-cutting measures, prioritizing vegetables over protein. Overall, an okay meal. It was affordable. Elroy Okada My sister and I decided to try Fu Lin Kitchen on a whim, we arrived 30 minutes before closing time but the lovely woman let us order what we wanted and the food arrived promptly. I had the beef brisket on rice and cucumber salad, while my sisters had sweet and sour chicken on rice and lemon chicken on rice. We all thoroughly enjoyed our meals, including my two year old who shared my beef brisket on rice with me. Cooked to perfection. Would definitely come back here again. Helena Fonoti Filipo I decided to try a new restaurant last night but can home somewhat disappointed. I believe the NEW OWNERS should work a little more with the quality and taste of the food. Most came out tasteless. Our Dry Hor Fun had nothing but broken rice noodle bits. The Wonton soup didn't have much flavor and was pretty blend. This restaurant was was really good a year back... Michael Lachica August 2023\/ Now under new ownership, still very acceptable, Saturday lunch was steady with 3-4 tables. 1\/ Usually do takeout, but today, decided to do lunch, all very pleasant, away from the hustle and bustle of Westcity, but still just a pedestrian crossing away, most enjoyable. 2\/ Drop in for dinner, didn’t disappoint as per photo. 3\/ Saturday night dinner, steady patronage, a very nice enjoyable meal for two. 4\/ another visit for Saturday lunch, under new ownership, standards are still high. cee doubleyou There's a lot of under rated Chinese places around and this is one of them.

They serve quite fast. The portions are big and the prices was good. They’ve had the same menu now for many years and a lot of people still come here for dinner\/lunch. Its nice you get soup on the side with rice. And bean sprouts for your soup. There are also condiments on the side. I love adding chilly on my soup. Gives it a kick. Melody Montaño This Vietnamese restaurant comes highly recommended, if you want a quick delicious Vietnamese meal. The food quality is great, portions are generous, and the service is both efficient and quiet, and very quick! The restaurant is spacious, offering plenty of indoor seating. I visited with my brother for dinner, and we both ordered the Lemongrass Chicken with rice. The chicken was tender, and the portion of rice was perfect to leave us feeling satisfied. This place never disappoints! Michael Kang I recommend the pork spare ribs and mango smoothie. The food is good and there’s parking outside the restaurant. However, the customer service is not very welcoming, and the takeaway experience isn’t worth the money soup isn’t included unless you pay extra. India Love Great place to get a decent meal at a reasonable price. Lemongrass chicken on rice, beef pho, crispy pork on rice all around 21 dollars. Drinks are good too - I had coconut nectar which is not too sweet. I liked it.

The service was smooth and great. The temp of the food was right and the rice was of good quality. This was the most authentic meal that I had in Dunedin. I highly recommend this restaurant for the most authentic Filipino dishes and the most tasty bento. BHH Rieffel The food is great! I've tried dishes from different Filipino restaurants and this place cooks the best lechon belly, dinuguan, and vegetable soup (5\/5 rating)! I'll give 3.5 to karekare as it needs improvement. Staff members are friendly and patient. The place is family-friendly. Overall I think its 4.7\/5.

Jana Reulecke Not really the flashiest place to dine in but the food is brilliant and service times are short. It was very busy when we dined but it was a short lasting rush. If you can, ignore the decor and just concentrate on the tasty food Layton Findlater Menu is Japanese-based but as the owners are Filipino they have 3 Filipino dishes on the menu and they are probably the best ones we've had so far here in Dunedin. Their crispy pata is a must and for it's price you'll be shocked at the size of it. The fried rice is good as well. Recommending it to my kiwi colleagues who love some juicy and crispy pork roast!

I do feel like, as a non-Chinese person, you may struggle to communicate with the wait staff.

Bee You can't deny they have some most delicious Chinese style roasted ducks here. Very surprising to find this restaurant only obtained 3.9. I don't know what other people think, at least, it has been in the market for more than 2 decades, still strong as always, nothing impacted by the economy. Eric Chou奧克蘭寶哥 The food was as good as before. I haven’t been here in four years.

Excellent food. Good portions. I had Dumplings, and they were large size and excellent quality. 👌 Sweet and Sour Pork fried rice was very good too. Meat was in good small chucks so no need to bite in half to take a bite. Note: Person that served me did not speak fluent English, so some patients required, but not an issue. Also the inside table sitting is only for 2 people, so TakeAway all the way. Alexei Borissenko I ordered Combo 2, which included 2 fish, chips, 2 hotdog, 2 nuggets and 2 potato fritter. The food was good overall, but I didn’t enjoy the fish, though the batter was still tasty. ANAND FRANCIS Imperial Takeaways has an extensive menu of Chinese takeaways which include many seafood type meals including deep fried Squid with chilli, rocksalt and onions. All meals are by number so try #16, 3, 83 and 87 they were great Graeme Wooller Excellent food, both in quality and variety. I've been a customer for over four years now. The menu is extensve and food is really nice. My favourites are crispy squid with spicy salt and sweet and sour fish. The couple that runs the shop are nice and friendly.

By adding their own cooking styles and ingredients, they provided a rich diversity, resulting in a unique cuisine. What holds this diverse cuisine together is the aromatic and flavourful spices. The art of Indian cooking is in blending the spices so that they are in perfect harmony in each dish.Northern Indian cooking is rich in meats, nuts, and amazing breads. The cuisine of western India is simpler, focusing on rice and lentils. The eastern coastline is blessed with abundant seafood, which is reflected in the cuisine of the region.Southern India is famous for its legendary pickles and chutneys.Indian cooking categorizes foods into six tastes â sweet, sour, salty, spicy, bitter, and astringent. A well-balanced Indian meal contains all six tastes. This is accomplished, in part, by accompanying the dishes with a wide variety of condiments.India village try to deliver all these tastes to its customers as the chefâs working here are well experienced.

Both were absolutely amazing. The broth was clean, warm, and flavourful, the portions of beef were generous, and the hand-made noodles were perfectly chewy and delicate. It felt like a truly authentic Chinese dining experience. One small piece of feedback: a lot of things are self-service (cutlery, cups, water, bowls), but the staff didn’t mention this upfront, so it took us a moment to figure it out. Overall, great food and definitely worth a visit for noodle lovers! Seulki Chung Lovely Lanzhou noodles perfect for the cold rainy weather. We usually struggle to find good Lanzhou noodles outside of Melbourne. So we came in with our doubts, but they definitely exceeded expectations. Soup had lovely flavours and just hit the soul. Noodles are freshly hand pulled and perfectly cooked. Meat was flavourful and tender. Portion are good as well. Price wise it’s okay and on par with most of the Queenstown restaurants. Melbourne Local The line for FBurger was around the block so tried here. Amazing food. Clean, fresh, fast, authentic. Really good flavour. Little tip, we got takeaway and went up to the Lookout to eat. Ashley Flower I really love their beef bone Noodle soup! I have it every time I come to Queenstown.

My first time visit here for a quick lunch, turns out a disappointing one. By looking at the posters on the wall, I had some expectations to my order. When it was served I was speechless because basically it's just some chopped roasted ducks soaking in a bowl red chilli oil, with a few veges, and that sells $25. If it's delicious I would totally feel okay because it's worth every penny you paid. Unfortunately, it's not the case. Well, I still finished all simply didn't want to waste my food since I already paid for it. But, there won't be a next time though. Eric Chou奧克蘭寶哥 Place: The ambience was lovely and it was clean (though I ate there during off-peak hours). Staff\/Counter\/Waitress: She is bubbly and helpful. She thought I don't know how to use chopsticks and so kind of her to offer me a fork. 🤣😛 Thanks miss! Food: I ordered 2 dishes, they are: 1. ND05 - Sour and spicy potato noodle (NZ$11.80) Not that bad, but not so good. Well, apart from the plum vinegar which gave the sour taste and the dried chilli with overflowing chilli oil on it that gives that spicy flavor, nothing much special with it even if there are minced pork and bean sprouts. 2. SF01 - Pork and Cabbage Fried Dumplings (NZ$14) I was surprised when I saw the dumplings as soon as it was served, the dough ends (wrapper) was light green and it smells pandan and definitely it was! Nice catch for that one but I don't think it goes really well with the filling and plum vinegar. There are 19 pieces but quite small compared to the usual and less filling inside thus what can you say with those 19 pieces, haha🤣. (PS: They just serve plum vinegar with it and when I asked for chilli and ginger, the staff said they do not have and she seemed puzzled why I will put ginger in it. Well, in my stay in Singapore, that's how they eat it and also my Chinese friends will nod to that too!) I didn't get to take photo of the dumplings because I actually forgot about it and awed with the colour. Debbie Reyes Very tasty mixure of Chinese foods. My favorites are the Chinese burger and the Chongqing xiao mian. They usually have Chinese TV shows on the TVs way too loud and if you don't speak good Chinese they tend to just take your order card and do it before you can verify some things you have ordered. As a result I have had the wrong thing more than once. David Lots of choices of Chinese food and beverages but unfortunately when I visited, there were also a lot of them marked temporary unavailable. The food did not disappoint though, good portion and very tasty. The menu is conveniently in both English and Chinese and there is a bell on each table when waiter attention is needed. Overall, the experience was pleasant and I’ll go back again to try more! Debby Wei PREV NEXT LOCATION × Average Customer Rating 3.8 I believe this is a Chinese dinner opening for some years.

I’d say tho if you are looking for a nice fancy restaurant and perfect service this place might not be for you, but if you’re in for the food and the kind family like hospitality this is it. The waitress was genuinely sweet and just her was enough to give the place 5 stars. The fact that the food was to die for was even better.

Really varied menu with some unique dishes that I haven't seen on menus before. We ordered a lot of dishes and every dish was fresh and delicious. Highlights were the roast pork, beef with ginger and spring onion, stuffed eggplant and pepper, fried dumplings and the chicken stuffed with shrimp paste and topped with almonds.

Caroline’s Outback Camping Ground Google Rating (out of 5): 4.4 Review Summary: Caroline’s Outback Camping Ground offers a serene getaway surrounded by stunning landscapes. Customers on platforms like Google Reviews and TripAdvisor have highlighted the peaceful atmosphere and well-maintained facilities. Many appreciate the friendly staff who provide helpful tips about local hikes and sights. The camping spots are spacious, allowing for a more private experience. On the downside, some visitors have noted that WiFi is limited, which can be a drawback for those wanting to stay connected. Others mentioned that road access could be tricky during wet conditions. Overall, Caroline\\'s provides a charming camping experience for nature lovers, though improvements in connectivity would enhance the stay. Last Update: 29\/04\/2025 Google Reviews Link: Google Reviews Link Address: 181 Somme Parade, Aramoho, , Whanganui, Manawatu, North Island DESCRIPTION: The camp is directly behind the Caroline's Boatshed Bar and E atery and TAB and beside the river and the railway line. The cluster of permanent living caravans and house buses, and the back yard bits and pieces around the place give the camp a lived-in, rather than a holiday feel. The ablutions and kitchen are basic.

He heard of the place from his friends so we decided to go there. We had Nasi Lemak with Rendang Beef, pineapple fried rice, and squid nestum. Hot Tea was complimentary. All the fare tasted great. Service was reasonably well. Atmosphere was just right. Asian and Kiwi customers were dining that night. All in all a very fine dining experience. VJR AD Real authentic tasting Malaysian cuisine. The portions are generous and the flavours are spot on. We had the deep fried snapper with curry sauce, Homemade egg tofu with soy sauce, Marmite Sauce Chicken and a Eggplant dish. Parking at the rear, but need to register on the Ipad once inside William Lin On the list for me top 3 Malaysian restaurants in Auckland (as of August 2025). Petaling serves up great food with great service. My pick to try are the butter floss range of dishes and the Kam Heong chicken. Make sure to book if you’re attempting to visit on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday 🤪 Ben Ch I had an amazing experience here. The flavors were rich, bold, and incredibly authentic — exactly what Malaysian food should be. The curry had the perfect balance of spice and aroma, the satay was tender with a delicious smoky char, and the kaya toast took me straight back to Southeast Asia. Every dish tasted like it was made with care and real attention to detail. The staff were warm and welcoming, happy to explain dishes and offer recommendations, which made my family so happy Kiwi Ki Top of my list for Malaysian food just sadly they close every Tuesdays. I love the food it's authentic Malaysian Food. 👍 and the kopi peng is almost the same the one they got in malaysian. 👏 L G × × - + ADD 0 ATTENTION × Are you sure you want to place this order for tomorrow?

The staff were absolutely amazing — super friendly, accommodating, and made us feel welcome from the moment we walked in. The cocktail selection was fantastic, with plenty of fun and creative options to try. We ordered the squid rings and spring rolls, and both were delicious! The dipping sauce was a little too spicy for my liking 🥴, but still packed with great flavor. We booked Karaoke Room 2, which fit our group of 10 comfortably — spacious, clean, and with an awesome song list that kept us singing all night! 🎤🎶 Overall, an awesome vibe, great service, and a perfect spot for a fun night out with friends. Highly recommend checking it out! Camerlite Tagiilima Good food, excellent Karaoke - the system looks newly upgraded and there are many latest songs inc Bruno Mars Dying with a smile, Malay songs, Korean songs etc. We went during happy hour $25pp includes $25 worth of food and 3 hours of karaoke room. Great selection of food and they were delicious and good portions. Easy, free parking. The ladies toilet when we went was a let down - it looks clean and nicely presented, however there was a really bad smell from the toilets - maybe the sewerage system was faulty - i had to cover my nose with my shirt when inside - a mask would have been a lifesaver. Michelle Ong Reviewing Karaoke only. Came here for \"Happy Hour\" on a Friday night 6pm to 9pm. Their phone number has issues, so we just turned up and there were rooms available. Although it may pay to book if you can. Reasonably priced for 3 hours and you can order food, which is added as part of your total minimum charge. Song selection is not bad. William Lin Very friendly and accomodating staff, karaoke system is OK to use but was much better onced we starting using their youtube app for songs not showing on their main system (PS: make sure to have \"karaoke\" in your youtube searches to get the lyric displayed music videos). Only negative was the sewage smell in the main reception area but karaoke rooms had aircon to prevent it lingering in there. Overall fun experience, would definitely go back.

Yudel, bloody Legend helped me pick my meal and gave me a great seat! Super friendly and had quite a few great laughs with him! Great atmosphere, and lighting! Got the lamb rump, the lamb was cooked perfectly! Medium rare! The portions of the plate were a bit howâs it going for the price but happy to try it out 02. Hugo MÃ©tivier While on vacation, my partner and I went to Number 8 Wire to taste some local Kiwi cuisine, and we were not disappointed. Everything was cooked to perfection and delicious!

    "homepage_content":"Regal Chinese Rest - Hamilton | Hamilton | ORDER ONLINE | Takeaway | TuckerFox NZ Regal Chinese Rest - Hamilton Chinese - 4.1 62 Bryce St, Hamilton 3204 × Average Customer Rating 4.1 My hubby and I had lunch at Regal Chinese Restaurant at Hamilton on 9\/7\/2025. As we went there at around 2:45pm, the lady staff told us that we had to order our food as soon as possible. We ordered four dishes very quickly. Food was okay but was not so impressive. Addie Lane Very quiet but good Chinese food, staff speak Mandarin and Cantonese. Food was tasty, it wasn’t oily. Emily Hui It’s really delicious — I’ve been here several times already. Elena First time trying dim sum in Hamilton, and it was okay! The sticky lotus rice was basically just sticky rice, barely any filling and colour. The prawn toast and deep fried pork dumpling was good Dana Young Yum Cha - the authentic Canton cuisine. Another great discovery. My wife had a short conference at Hamilton, and we decided to have a date. It has been a long time since I brought her for a good authentic Chinese cuisin, and both of us loved Dim Sum (点心) a touch of heart and I want to touch her heart through her mouth. I explored the night before and found this place Regal Chinese Restaurant (富豪- literally means rich man) to Yum Cha (饮茶 - drink tea) Of course, we need delicious Dim Sum to go with the tea. The reviews were not outstanding, but when we were welcomed by friendly waitresses and the ambience was very Cheena, we felt at home right away. In fact, the very success of a Chinese restaurant is to have a good chef. And I found out that he is from Canton. Canton cuisine is, to me, one of the most meticulous and uncompromising cuisines. That's why it is so delicious. The menu has so many items and we picked a few that we both like. E.g. Phoenix Crawl, (百合酱凤爪) Siew Mai, (烧卖) Chee Cheong Fun or Fun Cheong,(鲜虾肠粉) Salted Water Dumplings, (咸水角) and Lo Mai Gai (瑶柱糯米鸡) Our favourite of the day is really the Chee Cheong Fun or Fun Cheong,(鲜虾肠粉) and Siew Mai, (烧卖). The Fun Cheong is wrap with a steamed skin, soft and flavourful sauce. But when we took the first bite... my goodness, there is another layer of skin with is deep fried and crispy. Amazing skin within a skin. What a gastronomical pleasure when the softness and crunch mixed in union, it is unprecedented! Then when I took my first bite at the the Siew Mai, my literal expression is... woah! The Prawn is very fresh and the Pork is tender. A wonderful Q feeling when chewing the Siew Mai. This is definitely a destination for my family, friends, and for anyone who will visit us in NZ. They know who they are. troo foo × × - + ADD 0 ATTENTION × Are you sure you want to place this order for tomorrow?

Also great value for money. Definitely worth coming to. Special shoutout to the Sampan spicy fried noodles and the chicken in black bean sauce :)) Elissa Hall A hidden gem this place is indeed⭐️ I’m not the type to go the extra mile to post a review, however! This place deserves to be raved about. I have dined here many times, and each visit I have consistently had a meal that has been to the same quality of the last dish I have ordered of its kind. Dining in on Saturday night I ordered the fried noodles with chicken. Meal was flavourful and noodles were perfectly fried. The high level of tasty and love is definitely poured in to the food from Sampan and it’s nice to see a place do its basic offerings really well. Price and portion sizing is definitely lower in price and above par with its portions compared to competitors. Well worth the money. The restaurant and dining space is clean and the service is quick from ordering to receiving your meal. The owners are lovely and the food speaks of that love. J'adore (Jaja) The food wasn't met my expectations, but the chicken fried rice was nice. I like the smokey taste from the rice. The price was fine, but the services needed to be improved. The atmosphere is just ok, clean enough, and not many seats and tables are available. Erika Astried This is from my time in Dunedin and using zomato but due to death of zomato wanted to put this review somewhere. Hope Sampan house is still serving the goods. Update 12\/7\/19 ordered the red roasted pork belly and am I so glad it comes with a bowl of rice, and the portion for the price is pretty generous and very similar to the special rice dish of mao's braised pork belly that chopsticks have. Taste wise a sweet sauce but nothing spectacular, tasty, but I would've liked more sauce. The meat was tender but slightly more bouncy and firm, and could've done with more flavour. Compared to the chopsticks mao pork belly, definitely less oily with a more 'clean' feeling, but is more chewy with thicker cut pork chunks. Both are very good and of the same value, so depending on your mood, either is a good choice. 4\/5 Update 7\/7\/19 ordered the Sichuan spicy double cooked pork belly, a very decent portion for price with a good portion of meat and veg cooked with authentic flavour! Fantastic pork belly slices and they didn't slump out on portion of meat, and there was decent veg with a good bit of fungi, carrot, cabbage and onion. Rice is also included in the meal which is a bonus. Happy with the quality, definitely comparable to chopsticks! 4\/5 My friends ordered the ginger beef which was a generous portion and tasty, and and two crispy ducks. Everyone was very happy with their meal and everything came with a portion of rice. Dined in and ordered a medium beef supreme satay. Flavor was sweet yet. It overpowering but lacked in savory taste-however I was warned beforehand by the friendly staff there that this was a sweet dish. The peanut flavor was present and mixed well with the sweet flavor, the beef was cooked well, tender but still chewy. Portion was decent for the price. 3.5\/5 just because I wasn't blown away but makes a good quick eat out meal. Definitely keen to check them out again and try more of their menu! Rosie Lovely service and great food! Highly recommend. A great place for lunch away from the loud main street.

The space is pretty comfortable and their service is great! The food is delicious and pretty balanced! I will come back again someday whenever I can 😊 Alexandra Sanchez Review for Tasty BBQ Restaurant Tasty BBQ Restaurant is our go-to spot when we are in the area when it comes to casual catch-ups with family and friends. We dropped by for a lunch get-together and ordered a bit of everything to share—classic chips, BBQ fried rice, combination fried rice noodles, steamed BBQ pork buns, and salt & pepper squid. For drinks, we had the creamy mango and creamy honeydew pearl drinks. The meals were standard, nothing fancy or standout, but still satisfying enough to fill us up and keep the conversation flowing. The portion sizes were decent, and everything came out fresh and hot. The BBQ flavours were mild, and the pork buns were soft and enjoyable. The drinks were sweet and creamy, just as expected. Overall, it’s a simple spot with familiar flavours, perfect for a relaxed dinner with loved ones. If you’re not looking for anything too adventurous but want a comfortable place to sit down, share some plates, and leave feeling full—this place does the job. Salome Tatafu Just had dinner at this place. Not too big but sitting was comfortable. Understand the restaurant started only 6 months ago. The service was friendly and efficient. The lady serving spoke Mandarin but managed English well to handle your orders. So no worries. As for the food they were tasty and reasonably good. Prices were affordable. If you have problem ordering, just look at the wall. Pictures of dishes were posted all over with prices. A very good selection of dishes. Will definitely visit the place again. We had few dinners later and added more photos of the dishes we ordered. Tony Wan Decent food, nice portion (not so big that I wouldn’t have been able to finish). Beef brisket is a bit tough; could have been stewed longer. 月老mundi Great value for money. Big portions and the best perking duck I’ve had so far as takeout. The roasted pork is crunchy and less salty than many other places (which is a good thing) Rib with perking sauce and honey chicken are also dishes that I highly recommended. The only thing that I didn’t like was the fried rice noodle, I think they overcooked it so suggest if you want to have this dish, have it at the restaurant, not a good choice for takeaway.

Pete Sharpe 7 months ago Really good takeaway only food, at very reasonable prices. Good quantity and full of flavor. Currys have a good amount of meat as well...not just sauce and rice, like some others. Staff are friendly and helpful. Can order online or at the shop. ... Carlos Gellidon 10 months ago Out of all the Indian places I've eaten throughout Wellington this joint has the most bang for your buck. A lot of places have their curry lacking in meat, but not here! Not only that but the taste of the dishes was great in general. The butter lamb, biryani, and beef masala really stood out. If you stop by Paraparaumu, definitely check this place out. ...

Was very clean and Very delicious food. Would definitely be going there again. Chicken fried rice was delicious with a lot of chicken chunks. Fried chicken nibbles was fresh and batter was very crunchy. Pork bun tasted as good as the one I had previously at Stanley roast Kelston. Cost was reasonable will definitely be going back when in town. Neetah Ordered wonton noodle soup via uber eats. Comes with about 7 or 8 large pork wontons with good flavour and well cooked (firm cooked meat texture vs jelly meat mushy like some others. Broth isn't anything amazing but is fine and veges were fresh. Wairaka Mason The food here is good! I don’t know why but I’ve always avoided this place… The honey chicken w\/ fried rice will have you hooked. Nasi goreng is alright too, but not spicy enough lol. Give them a go. M TL Really clean kitchen and it is run by husband (chef) and wife. I tried their 9th dish on the menu : 3 in 1 Mixed Chicken Fried Rice, Combination Chow Mein (Pork & Beef), Egg Foo Young . Perfectly cooked juicy and taste with good quantity of crunchy vegetables (carrot, onion, broccoli, cauliflower). The chef cooks simultaneously 3 dishes on 3 woks and he is an artist with precision the way he adds spice to food. The best part is food wasn't oily, taste, good quantity, generous amount of meat and even after eating more than half of the meal doesn't feel too heavy on the stomach as it is not oily. Great customer service. Will return back to try rest of the menu.

Great service and yummy food. Our favourite takeaways! I’m not sure how they got the double sautéed pork so succulent but it was perfect. The pork dim sim full of meat and again so tasty they didn’t last long as soon as we opened it. The potato fritters are made by hand and while crispy and crunchy on the outside the soft hot potato on the inside is a match made in heaven. Bonn appetite! Brad Sickler The owners Allan and Shuwen were so hospitable and down to earth with their amazing sense of humour and warm presence. If you've had the same thing, you can ask them what you feel like and they will make amazing recommendations on what to try. We got abit of a feast with orange chicken 🐔, seasonal warm vegetables, in-house made dumplings, twice cooked pork with there delicious sauce, crabsticks, yummy wonton and the BEST POTATO FRITTERS in the whole of Wellington! If you are looking for a place were the food is good and the banter is great too, you got to go see the boys over at Wadestown Chinese Takeaways! If you are wondering where the potato fritters are in the picture, I ate them before we even got home, but they are crispy little nuggets thst have fallen from heaven and made there way in to the Menu!!! You will be so happy to come here! 🤗😎😍👍 Ti Ai Great local specialist Chinese Takeaway service. Can recommend the Beef in Black-bean Sauce which is a favourite. Have also tried SZECHUAN STYLE - Beef (served with white rice). Plenty of options to explore. It said that the secrets in the sauce or is the sauce in the secret, we’re not sure but they have definitely got the sauce worked out. Two really good people, Allan & Shuwen are good to talk to. Do you speak Mandarin they do and they’re quite happy to hear a few words while you wait. Fish & Chips highly recommend but generally go for the Chinese menu. Order online, by phone or just turn up.

Worth the Wait for Authentic Bliss.** I visited Wangwang Pancake on Father's Day 2025, and despite the expected chaos, it was a fantastic experience that absolutely lived up to the hype. This place is a genuine treasure on Dominion Road. Let's talk about the **service** first. Yes, it was incredibly busy—a testament to how popular this spot is—and yes, it did take a significant amount of time to get our food. However, this is where Wangwang shines in its fairness and communication. They have a brilliant system where orders are completed table-by-table. A simple glance at the order numbers on the board told us exactly how many tables were ahead of us. This transparency completely removes any frustration from the wait. You know you haven't been forgotten and that your turn is coming. The staff were hustling non-stop, managing a constant stream of both dine-in customers and a huge number of Hungry Panda delivery orders. They were efficient and focused, and we completely understood the pace given the special day. The **atmosphere** is exactly what you'd expect from a bustling, authentic eatery—it's vibrant, noisy, and not great. It's not a quiet, romantic fine-dining spot; it's a place where people come for seriously good food. The buzz of conversation, the sizzle from the kitchen, and the constant flow of delivery drivers create a lively and real environment. I also loved seeing the diverse mix of customers—from families celebrating Father's Day to groups of friends and, wonderfully, several Pākehā diners all enjoying the food. It’s a great sign of a place that transcends cultural boundaries and appeals to everyone who appreciates quality cuisine. Now, the main event: the **food**. It was nothing short of excellent and met every expectation. We ordered a variety of their signature pancake rolls and they were worth every minute of the wait. The pastry was perfectly flaky and layered, achieving that incredible crunch without being greasy. The fillings were generous, flavourful, and fresh. Each bite was a perfect combination of texture and taste. It's clear that everything is made to order with care, which is why it takes time. This isn't fast food; it's fresh, authentic Chinese street food made with skill. In summary, Wangwang Pancake is a must-visit. Manage your expectations: go knowing it might be busy and you'll need a little patience, but be assured that the system is fair and the payoff is immense. The food is spectacular, authentic, and worth every cent. I will absolutely be back, though maybe on a slightly less hectic day! Highly, highly recommend. Hao Very authentic Chinese wraps where you order the individual fillings and assemble your pancake. The flavours are good - a little oily but you can ask for a less salt and less oil. Generous portions at a reasonable and affordable price makes this a good option for sharing. They also have dumplings and Chinese breads. Recommended! Joy Wang Great food and well priced. Basic decor but it’s all about the food. Damian Arnold You'll love the tasty food at a great price here. The pancakes are filled with delicious veggies and meat. Even though the place is small and busy, the staff is super friendly, the place is clean and parking is a breeze. Augustine Tea This is one of our favourite place for lunch. It is a small place and usually quite crowded. Be early and you will get your table. Though small but sitting was pretty comfortable. Service was friendly and the food was good. The servings were reasonable and the prices were affordable. If you like some simple Chinese food, this may be the place for you.

Food is consistently good. Good size main that we share. Love the papadoms nepalimeronaam 2013-07-06 20:14:44 Momo was wonderful. I felt eating in Nepal Julian Donald 2013-10-28 18:58:45 Horrible, sweet, no spice flavour at all! Louise Denton 2013-11-16 20:48:22 We have been to Everest many times - always for takeaways - and we have never had a bad meal from them. Tonight, we took some friends to dine in there. We have been raving about this place for ages, so we were a little nervous that it wouldn't be as good as we had said, but it was and then some. They are always so friendly and welcoming in there, and the food was, as always, simply beautiful. The vegetarian meals were amazing and the meat dishes were tender and flavourful. The naans were perfect - I cannot recommend the sweet naans enough - and don't get me started on the poppadoms. I usually hate poppadoms, not here! If you are looking for the best Indian in Christchurch, then you will find it at Everest Indian. David Harrow 2015-06-11 11:34:53 Great value for money and excellent food....

Happy customer with two thumbs up😁 J Lau 2nd time there, I purchased the 20 dollar chicken pizza and the Lamb Kebab on rice with salad this time. Very much enjoyed the meal. Meat had good flavor and sauces I choose went well with the salad and rice. I loved the pizza, will be going back there, the mushrooms and the chicken worked very well for flavors. Friendly service and takes the time to make good food : ) I enjoy food that is good and more so when it actually fills your belly!

A tad bit greasy but that didn’t detract from the beautiful tasting fillet. Fillet was clean and fresh and boardering on melt in your mouth territory! Chips - Hand Cut!!! Cooked well with a nice bite and soft on the inside! Portion size was generous. Took with me two pieces of buttered bread with Best Foods mayo which was an excellent accompaniment to the fish and hand cut chips! The chips were damn near perfect! Well worth the Sunday drive out from Petone! The shop is right next to the Island Bay bar. There is a car park and access from the back of the shop. Mark Panapa Indulged myself to fish and chips for Xmas treat. The fish of the day was Warehou, a decent size compared to other shops and crumbed nicely. However the chips were no longer than 2\" in length appearing to be cheaper ends\/offcuts. A decent length chip would be nicer to savour the flavour.

The food was prepared very promptly, and it’s open until very late, which is great in case you get the munchies after a night out. It’s a shame that kebabs and meat with chips are more expensive than they used to be, but that’s more of a general comment. The meat and sauce options here are as good as any. A solid choice overall. Sang Hyun Kim Very pleasantly surprised by this place! We got hungry after midnight and found this place near our hotel. Really tasty, great portions, lots of veggies in the wrap!! very clean inside, friendly staff! Gloria Song Wow my option was the falafel burger combo... boy oh boy was my dinner and save some for midnight snack... This falafel mix is beautiful so tasty - I am a meat lover but I was dying to find somewhere who can do it well $24 at the time of my visit for burger, decent amount of chips and a drink - not a very long wait and service was quick and friendly...I am very happy I'll be back to try more Harmony K × × - + ADD 0 ATTENTION × Are you sure you want to place this order for tomorrow?

The chef is very consistent in his cooking which we appreciate, as not all chinese restaurants are consistent and you never know what you're gonna get. Not here! The free jasmine tea is enjoyable as it's not too strong, not too weak (the owner says she buys the tea leaves from a specialty shop). The 20% off promotion is still available!

The other mains are also super tasty and portion sizes are huge. The food comes out pretty fast. Very authentic- my Chinese families favourite place.

Dorje Mckinnon My spouse loves this place. They got out of the hospital and the first thing they wanted was to order the udon through UberEats. It's their favourite udon in this city. I also enjoy the salmon teriyaki and chicken katsu donburi and we always get several miso soup as they're quite good. Morgan Platt First time here, I ordered a Teriyaki Tofu Don (rice bowl) - being vegetarian I am limited when it comes to decent amount of Japanese food so this is my regular go-to order.

Their price is so much $4-5 cheaper than my local and enjoyable meal experience HeEt Joshi It always feels like home to me. The main thing i love about this take away shop is the taste and the service. No complaints with taste and service. diana Give this place a try if you are into Paradise or Bawarchi.

Louise Bettridge Great friendly people and always give me great food and great service! I recommend their (takeaway) lunch menu\/special and I have never had problems with them and have been going there for at least 3 years! :) Glenn C The food here is great. This place if more suited to takeaways, tho it has a few tables there, but for a small shop they do some of the best curries around. They have a lot of flavour and are pretty consistant.

Buffet $30 Saturday *Terms & Condition Apply Entree Mains Desserts Drinks Welcome to Chapati Indian Restaurant, Henderson Auckland – Dine in and Takeaway Traditionally the thing to serve with curries, is either Chapati (Roti) or Naan instead of bread and it would be true to say that most homes in India still make their daily batch of fresh Chapatis. Chapati is unleavened bread made of either white flour orunsifted meal with a little shortening, but instead of being baked they are toasted over a griddle till they are freckled gold. To see a freshly stacked pile of Chapatis is a sight that will tempt any age group, and many a child has snatched one whilst mother is not looking.

Sunil Shrestha This shop serves the most delicious chicken nibbles, chips, and roast pork—always fresh, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. The environment is clean, pleasant, and inviting. Highly recommended! Ranjan Mainali Best food and excellent customer service. The staffs are super friendly and make you feel very welcome. Highly recommended! Shritika Shrestha The roast meals are always good especially the roast pork meal and that pork crackling is fire! The hot chips, fried chicken and chicken nibbles are some of the best in Auckland! Service is great too except sometimes a grumpy lady behind the counter who can't take a joke and also when they say the hot chips will take \"7 minutes\" but it takes double that! (NOTE: I am describing my interaction with the previous owners, not the current new owners who were running the shop the week before Christmas 2023).

We ate here in late November and I they managed to get a table for us at short notice as the restaurant was fully booked. The food is probably the best I have eaten in Auckland for some time and the service was excellent. We had a variety of entrees, main courses and fried rice and everything was so delicious. DEBORAH H. Excellent food & excellent service. Amy & her staff will take excellent care of you during your visit. Very friendly & accommodating. The flavours are amazing & variety of dishes excellent. Butter prawns fantastic. CAMERON B. We know live on the skirts of Auckland but this was one of our favourite haunts. Went with our friends pre-Xmas. Food was delicious. Favourites include butter prawns, Singapore noodles, cumin lamb, lemon chicken and the garlic beans were to die for.

Go eat at this place asap!! chris vincent Lovely little restaurant with incredibly flavourful food 😍 I came here with my wife to quench a craving for Thai food last week. We were very satisfied with our meals! Reasonably priced dinner with good portion sizes! Thanks so much for the great food! ☺ I'll be back again soon for more of the lemongrass and Basil stir-fry 🤤 Quintin Swanepoel 10\/10 Establishment. Great food, biker friendly. Very accommodating! Would recommend! Jack Carter I eat here at least once a week. I’m a real big supporter of Thai food and I must say the food is absolutely delicious, it’s well priced and the customer service is absolutely first class. Danny de Hek",

It's a great idea and it was very yummy. A number of side dishes are included in the all you can eat menu as well. Stephen Infield First time trying the ‘all you can eat’ with family who have previously visited. Each flavour of chicken wad delicious!! My favourite was the wasabi mayo & original. Great value for $35pp (I didn’t managed to get pics of the other sides). Definitely will be coming back, very fast service and friendly staff 🥰 Montana Karsey I had an incredible dining experience at China Beach! The food was absolutely delicious — authentic flavours and perfectly cooked dishes that left me wanting more. What truly made the visit special, though, was the outstanding service provided by a young man named Jamie. He was attentive, friendly, (and attractive) and made sure everything was perfect throughout the meal. Jamie’s warm and professional approach added a wonderful touch to the whole experience. I highly recommend China Beach to anyone looking for fantastic Chinese cuisine paired with top-notch service. Five stars all the way - Cooper Cooper10x1 Tofts We went for the all you can eat chicken The chicken was really nicely cooked, crispy coating, chicken perfectly cooked. It's noted the chicken is all the same, just different sauces or coating - beware the honey soy- extremely salty! The service was average at best, long delays between dishes, no explanation on what to expect or how to order, items missing etc. Ambiance is what is missing most. The restaurant area is functional, but it lacks personality and warmth and leaves you feeling a bit like a perching short stay visitor. Adjusting the lighting and investing in staff performance could see this average restaurant reach new heights and popularity. L R Ordered Chicken Chop Suey, and the Mongolian Beef. Plus some sides. The dishes were 10 stars, loads of flavour, and a nice difference between them to really showcase the chefs skills. Good ratio of meat to vege, and the bok choy in the chicken dish was a fantastic alternative to the usual,cheap celery that many others use and no one likes. The chicken was nicely sized too, so you got a good balance between the sauce in the dish, and the actual flavour of the chicken, which was really well done, and not soggy from baking soda like other restaurants do. My daughter raved over the spring rolls, the best she has had. The only let down, and maybe room for improvement, was the won tons, they didn't seem to have any filling, and appeared to simply be a folded over piece of pastry, the photo showing the size next to my fork, so just won't order those again, especially for the price. But still 5 stars and I look forward to going there and eating in to try the other dishes.

Ordered some Egg Fried Rice and must admit they tasted so good. As usual, fast and quick service. Pricing on point. Will be back again. Richie The roast duck on rice at their place is the best I've had in Auckland. The duck skin is exceptionally crispy, yet the meat is not tough at all; it's very tender and so juicy. The service of their staff is also very good. Every time, they greet me warmly. yo yo Service was great, portions were large, and the restaurant was clean. Convenient because they don’t take a break between lunch and dinner service so can go any time. K S For me this is the best Chinese restaurant managed by a lovely family. Food is great, not pricey. Best place to eat and take away. ab nieva Had a lunch there with my partner and overall experience is ok. The portion is small and salty and comparing the price (over $20) which made me bit upset.

Judy Chan Stopped in for dinner while in Hamilton recently. Ordered the vegetable curry on rice. Nicely cooked with fresh veges but the 'curry' wasn't what I was expecting. I've encountered this before and it's more of a pale yellow liquid with a bit of heat but without the *real* yellow curry taste and aroma. Other than this the dish was ok and the service was good. S W New owner? Brought a fish burger. It was empty. A burger always starts with a meat patty. Then you add an extra like a fish or egg or bacon or steak or cheese... or ham and pineapple. Then you add your salad and sauce. I got a fish, tartare sauce. Wafer thin slice of tomato and 2 little pieces of steamed iceburg lettuce. That's a fish sandwich. Not a burger.

Great portions, delicious food, friendly service Kimberly Fitzgerald Went here to get a chinese meal a few weeks ago. I ordered the roast pork wonton noodle soup, which tasted absolutely amazing! Very impressive quality of meat and wontons, making the dish great value for money. I have been to Fang's many times for both fish and chips as well as Chinese and never disappoints. Daniel Wallis I love the combination fried rice there specially. Even vegetable cutting is thin and and nice. Love the food. Best fried rice I had in my life for sure.

Excellent food in convenient location. We ordered the sweet and sour pork, kailan veggie, prawn with vegetable and fried kuay teow. Desert was coconut jelly. All excellent and fresh! Highly recommended.. alan poh Wish I could rate higher. Service and food are absolutely phenomenal. We enjoyed a variety, as is expected. Everything was clearly very fresh, carefully prepared and delicious. The wait staff are so professional, prompt and courteous. So glad we stopped in. Heather Murphy Formally Dragonboat, it was wonderful to see the restaurant open on Saturday night. Special mention for Felix, who always remembers us (and our favourite drinks). An absolute credit to the business and hospitality industry. Much loved Chinese restaurant for Asian flight crews. Very well deserved. Booking for large groups is recommended as most of the larger tables were reserved. Sally W A good Chinese spot in the city centre, this has been an established place to come and eat since the 90s. I came here for Yum Cha recently with a group of work colleagues and enjoyed myself. The food was nice and the restaraunt is presentable enough. My only critic is that it is a older restaraunt and could use some new life breathed into it (new decor or new food flavours). T Ordered a lunch special which also came with an egg tart and soup. Ordered additional rolled steam like noodles rolls with beef which are very nice. The duck and pork rice a , the crispy skin on the pork wasn’t exactly crispy but the taste was still nice. Service from the place was great and friendly and has the thumbs up definitely. Didn’t eat inside the restaurant but there it by a food court sitting area and I found that pleasant with the different music playing by the mall.

Specially a halal menu. Can accommodate different group sizes. Would be a nice place to hang around with friends and family. Food was superb and delicious and I visited second time as well. Beijing roast duck was amazing and I tried it for the first time. Dumplings tasted well. We tried out many dishes there and did not regret of ordering and tasting for the first time. Definitely recommend and worth visiting many times to taste the food since they consistently maintain the same level of quality. Shafwana Shafeek This restaurant has giving me a great curiosity and challenged me to have a lunch here: 1. Why someone named a restaurant a FORBIDDEN CITY? It's very COOL like a movie title, but it's not. 2. It have a neon sign when open, even in the afternoon. It's weird but interesting for me! 3. the interior was not very inviting but at the same time very authentic?? 4. And then.. Serving an authentic chinese peking duck as a recommended menu?? 5. Some of the so-called Halal food wasn't leave a good impressions but okay I give it a try. I came with my wife on her birthday because she's craving peking duck from a long time, and we growing curiosity in this restaurant together. We ordered Roasted duck and Corn soup. The soup arrived first. My impressions is positive. The flavour was balanced. When you put some soy sauce and chilli oil, it hits different!! It was very perfect because we eating when outside is rainy so it warm our mouth, head and body. The roasted pecking duck became our \"main course\", along with the rice. We are very overwhelmed with the flavour. It's juicy, delicious, crispy skin... We could never want anything more than this!! The last bite still feel it's was first bite.. What an experience. When we finished and wanna pay, I never expected this: they selling the chilli oil!! Chilli oil here is very mandatory and never skip this on every meals here. Forbidden City is a proof that your restaurant doesn't have to be a gimmicky interior and striking sign to be a good restaurant. The name itself, the food, is enough reason to you why you should stop here and go home with the stuffed stomach. Very recommended. Abdul Razzaq I found the balance of flavour in all the dishes too much on the sweet side for me and the orange beef lacked a crispy batter. Helen Joe If you’re looking for an authentic halal Chinese restaurant with great food, large servings and quick service, this is the place to be. Bookings are recommended as they do get filled up some nights. I’ve been to many Chinese restaurants and this sits well on top of my list and the food is always consistent and service is quick no matter how busy they are. Eugene T Anyone who asks for the best Peking duck in Wellington, this is where you come! They have the best chef from Beijing and you get so much meat! You can choose \"one way\", 2 ways (Peking duck with noodle stir fry) or 3 ways (duck bone soup) basically just use the rest of the duck and not wasting them. We got the 3 ways and the soup is nice and refreshing, noodles we could live without but it's fine. Bonus is their cold dish mung bean noodles is the best I've ever had and love their stir fried eggplant with mince stuffing.

It's definitely a great spot for a bunch of people to yum char together. Mcenergy This restaurant truly impressed me with its **excellent value for money** and **generous portions**—a rare combination in today's dining scene. The **silky-smooth rice noodle rolls (cheung fun)** and **juicy, perfectly textured siu mai** are absolute highlights But the surprises don't stop there! Their **Peking duck two-way preparation** deserves special mention: **crispy skin** **succulent, flavorful meat**. The creative pairing with **stir-fried shredded duck and bean sprouts** adds wonderful texture contrast. Other standout dishes include: - **Yu Xiang eggplant clay pot**: A masterful balance of spicy, sweet and savory notes - **Seafood tofu hotpot**: Creamy tofu swimming in an umami-rich broth - **Golden-fried shrimp balls**: Crispy exterior giving way to bouncy, fresh shrimp filling What truly sets this establishment apart is its **skillful execution of both regional Chinese cuisines**—from Cantonese classics to Northern specialties. Every dish showcases **quality ingredients** and **traditional cooking techniques**, yet remains accessible through **reasonable pricing**. Perfect for family gatherings or casual dining, this is the kind of place that keeps you coming back to explore more of the menu. Already planning my next visit to try their other dim sum varieties!

Photos are from both visits ☺️ ffa b Wasn't supposed to go to this place for lunch but we did anyways, and I was pleasantly surprised. The food is very good and the service fantastic. The servings generous to justify the price . ENKI'S FUN TECHNO STUFF (EnkiTrillionaire) My new fav yum char and i have been to loads of top ones in Auckland. Such great flavour, choose from menu and they cook to order so its super fresh and hot. Its in an old building with great views over the city. It's definitely a great spot for a bunch of people to yum char together. Mcenergy This restaurant truly impressed me with its **excellent value for money** and **generous portions**—a rare combination in today's dining scene. The **silky-smooth rice noodle rolls (cheung fun)** and **juicy, perfectly textured siu mai** are absolute highlights But the surprises don't stop there! Their **Peking duck two-way preparation** deserves special mention: **crispy skin** **succulent, flavorful meat**. The creative pairing with **stir-fried shredded duck and bean sprouts** adds wonderful texture contrast. Other standout dishes include: - **Yu Xiang eggplant clay pot**: A masterful balance of spicy, sweet and savory notes - **Seafood tofu hotpot**: Creamy tofu swimming in an umami-rich broth - **Golden-fried shrimp balls**: Crispy exterior giving way to bouncy, fresh shrimp filling What truly sets this establishment apart is its **skillful execution of both regional Chinese cuisines**—from Cantonese classics to Northern specialties. Every dish showcases **quality ingredients** and **traditional cooking techniques**, yet remains accessible through **reasonable pricing**. Perfect for family gatherings or casual dining, this is the kind of place that keeps you coming back to explore more of the menu. Already planning my next visit to try their other dim sum varieties!

I soon became so busy in my own \"little\" business that I had to buy another van and start employing staff. I eventually sold a portion of the area I owned to serve my customers' expectations better. I look after half of Palmerston North with the surrounding areas of Feilding, Bulls, Sanson, Marton, the northern Manawatu district, and across some Whanganui areas. I'm sure you would have seen my distinctive sign written van zooming around the district. Both my partner Chris and I are very involved in the community and enjoy a stroll around the Palmerston North golf course together whenever we can. I support our local golf club by sponsoring an annual golf tournament known as the Harrisons Carpet Open Day, a very popular event.I believe my strength is listening to what my customers want and trying my best to deliver to their expectations so they can be delighted with their experience dealing with Harrisons. Get in touch with us today for an appointment, and remember - we come to you! Book a free consultation General enquiry Testimonials Here's what the locals had to say...

Actually, it was a quick light lunch I had with 3 colleagues the previous month that I decided to come back for a full meal. The food was not only good but the portions were huge compared with other Chinese restaurants. We had lemon fish, sweet & sour pork, combination fried rice, combination vegetables & deep fried mushrooms. Added some Yum Char dishes as they were available; not just during lunch time. So good that I took 2 of my colleagues there for Yum Char the next day; which they thoroughly enjoyed. Not sure why they were not very busy like other Chinese restaurants that have Yum Char. Another pus for this restaurant is that there is no surcharge for paywave & I was able to use my credit card to earn airpoints. They also didn't charge for takeaway containers for our leftovers; again unlike the other restaurants. Will certainly be back again soon. Andy Andy Authentic Chinese food with generous portions! The dishes tasted just like back home, very flavorful and well-prepared. Portions are huge, two of us couldn’t finish and had to pack the leftovers, which was great for later. Highly recommend if you’re looking for real Chinese flavors and value for money. Hui Shan Tan My wife and I decided to eat here after hearing good reviews from friends. The food portions were huge, and everything was absolutely delicious. The highlight of the meal was definitely the Peking duck with pancakes. The service was perfect. The staff were very attentive and made sure all of the customers were well taken care of. Wiremu Wallace I could not recommend this place enough. The food is outstanding and the staff are more than 5 star. This is our new favorite place. We absolutely love everything about this restaurant and I know you will as well.

In my opinion they do the best chips out of our three local Chinese takeaway because of the golden crispy crunch the chips have. Smaller portioned but best quality. I also tried their spicy sliced pork belly on white rice with vegetables as it was a recommended dish under reviews on their website. Have tried the same dish at Mt Albert & Mt Eden. They do not compare to this place and the way they do it. My favourite dish is the Chicken Rice Noodles dish. It’s so satisfying as a comfort food. And the servings sizes of these two dishes are worth the price. The owners are friendly. I hope they will stay open for as long as I am here. The others just don’t seem to compare.

    "homepage_content":"Gates of Olympus slot online 🎰 | Play Gates of Olympus demo — New Zealand Casino Play Gates of Olympus for real money Official site for New Zealand players Gates of Olympus We help New Zealand players resolve issues with online casinos and make sure your complaints are delivered directly to the game developers. On our platform, you can learn about the legality and safety of online gaming in New Zealand, and we feature only trusted and regulated operators. We’ve gathered casinos that support NZD currency and popular local payment methods such as POLi, Skrill, and credit cards for your convenience. You’ll also find exclusive promotions and updates from local casinos and from Pragmatic Play, giving Kiwi players early access to bonuses and events. Remember to play responsibly — Gates of Olympus is pure entertainment, not a way to make money. Play free Play for real money Author Edward Denham Update October 14, 2025 Content Content Gate of Olympus brings a 6×5 layout with “pay anywhere” wins: land eight or more matching symbols anywhere on the grid and the Tumble feature clears them, letting fresh symbols drop for consecutive hits in one paid spin. Multipliers can spark at any time from 2× up to 500×—and if several appear during a tumble sequence, their values add together before applying to the total win. Four or more scatters launch 15 Free Spins where every multiplier you collect builds a running total that applies across the feature, creating genuine step-change moments when the screen connects. For players in Aotearoa, the experience is tuned for convenience: leading NZ-facing casinos support NZD balances, quick registration, local payment options such as POLi, Skrill, and bank transfer, and responsive support aligned to New Zealand time zones. Our free demo mirrors the main game’s interface and maths, so you can explore pay-anywhere wins, tumbles, and Zeus’s thunderbolt multipliers with no deposit. Fairness sits at the core. Gate of Olympus operates under licensing frameworks recognised internationally (including MGA, UKGC, and Gibraltar), with outcomes produced by certified RNGs and a standard RTP of 96.50%. Operators cannot alter the game algorithm the logic runs on secure servers with audited configurations. For NZ players, data is encrypted and responsible-play tooling is readily accessible. What to expect in session: in typical play the base game produces frequent smaller connections via tumbles, with multipliers appearing periodically and the bigger spikes arriving when Free Spins are active and the global multiplier grows. Illustrative figures from our NZ guide suggest roughly one payout in about four spins, multipliers appearing about once every 8–10 spins, Free Spins about once in ~250 spins, and a long-odds ceiling of 5,000×. Treat these as averages over time rather than promises they reflect the high-volatility profile that makes Olympus a thrill when Zeus strikes. On desktop and mobile, the interface keeps the essentials within easy reach Spin, Autoplay, and bet controls are immediate, with clean readouts for stake, win, and balance. Animations stay crisp as symbols tumble and the screen brightens when multipliers land the audio swells during feature transitions without pulling focus during longer sessions. The demo preserves this flow exactly, making it a practical way to get comfortable before switching to real play. Interface Review The interface of the gates of olympus game embodies a sense of divine power balanced with clear usability. The layout draws inspiration from ancient Greek architecture — marble columns, glowing gemstones, and a radiant figure of Zeus overseeing the reels. Every visual element feels purposeful, maintaining a clean alignment between art direction and functional clarity. The control panel is streamlined for both desktop and mobile experiences. The Spin, Autoplay, and Bet adjustment buttons are positioned within immediate reach, eliminating unnecessary scrolling or searching. The responsiveness of the buttons gives a feeling of precision, with subtle lighting effects confirming each interaction. Players can read all vital information — current bet, total win, and balance — without crowding the lower section of the screen. Animations flow with natural rhythm, particularly when the tumbling symbols cascade after a win. Each movement is framed to enhance visual satisfaction rather than distract. The transitions between normal play and bonus rounds are smooth, aided by atmospheric lighting shifts and intensified sound cues that highlight Zeus’s interventions. The balance between vivid effects and user control prevents sensory overload while keeping engagement high. Elegant Greek-themed interface blending mythic power and modern design The upper section features Zeus prominently, holding thunderbolts ready to strike during random multipliers. This visual anchor reinforces the theme and offers players instant recognition of game states. The color palette — dominated by gold, sapphire, and royal purple — conveys grandeur while maintaining contrast for readability. Sound design complements the interface’s clarity. Each interaction, from pressing Spin to watching the symbols fall, is supported by short, impactful tones that match the visual energy of the experience. Music fades subtly during extended play sessions to keep focus on gameplay. In gates of olympus free play , the same visual and functional structure is maintained, allowing users to explore all features without the pressure of wagering. The intuitive interface remains identical to the main version, serving both new players learning mechanics and returning players refining strategies. Overall, the presentation aligns with Pragmatic Play’s philosophy — visually rich, logically structured, and built for smooth interaction across all devices. Every design choice emphasizes clarity and excitement, making each session feel as monumental as a storm from the gods themselves.

Trusted platforms for players from New Zealand Key Criteria for Winning Online Casinos in New Zealand Players seeking success in Gates of Olympus by Pragmatic Play often focus on five main factors that distinguish trusted and rewarding platforms. Each element contributes to a fair and enjoyable gaming experience, especially for New Zealand players who value reliability and entertainment quality. Key factors that define reliable online casinos 1. High RTP and Transparent Mechanics Winning platforms display clear information about return-to-player percentages and game volatility. Gate of Olympus offers an RTP of 96.50%, giving users confidence in predictable performance and statistical fairness. 2. Licensed and Verified Operators A secure casino must hold recognized licenses, often from the Malta Gaming Authority, UK Gambling Commission, or New Zealand–friendly regulators. Verified sites provide protection for deposits, winnings, and personal data. 3. Local Payment and Currency Options Top-performing casinos allow NZD deposits and withdrawals through trusted systems such as POLi, Skrill, or direct bank transfers. Fast processing and no hidden conversion fees make gaming more convenient. 4. Bonuses with Clear Terms A good casino provides welcome offers and transparent wagering conditions. Sites offering gates-of-olympus free spins no deposit promotions attract players who prefer risk-free entry into the game’s dynamic features. 5. Mobile Compatibility and Support Winning casinos deliver flawless gameplay across desktop and mobile devices. Responsive customer service, including live chat for New Zealand time zones, strengthens trust and encourages consistent play. Rules and Gameplay When you play Gates of Olympus , the journey begins across a 6×5 grid filled with radiant gemstones and divine symbols watched over by Zeus himself. Instead of traditional paylines, the game uses a “pay anywhere” system — matching eight or more symbols anywhere on the screen results in a win. Once a winning combination lands, the Tumble feature activates, removing winning symbols and allowing new ones to fall, potentially creating consecutive wins within a single spin. Each spin carries the chance of triggering a multiplier symbol — glowing orbs held by Zeus — that can range from 2× to 500×. When multiple multipliers appear during a tumble sequence, their total value is added together before being applied to the overall win, creating the potential for powerful combinations. Understanding gameplay mechanics and rules Landing four or more scatter symbols, represented by Zeus’s golden crown, activates the Free Spins round. Players receive 15 free spins, and every multiplier collected during this feature is added to a global multiplier that remains active for all remaining spins. This accumulation mechanic brings escalating excitement as each win contributes to a growing total. For players exploring the demo Gates of Olympus version, all the same mechanics apply, offering an authentic experience without financial commitment. The demo mode is ideal for understanding game flow, symbol values, and the thrill of chaining tumbles before switching to real play. Main Advantages The design and mechanics of Gate of Olympus deliver a balance of excitement, fairness, and innovation. From its unique payout system to its visually powerful presentation, the game provides an engaging experience tailored to both new and experienced players in New Zealand. Below are four defining advantages that make this title stand out among Pragmatic Play’s portfolio and in leading online casinos offering a gatesofolympus no deposit bonus option. Advantage Description Pay Anywhere Mechanic Wins are formed by landing eight or more matching symbols anywhere on the reels, not limited by paylines. This structure gives each spin multiple ways to generate rewards and keeps gameplay dynamic. Multiplier Excitement Random multiplier orbs appear during any spin, carrying values from 2× to 500×. When several appear together, they combine into a total multiplier, amplifying the overall result in a single thrilling moment. Free Spins with Global Multiplier Landing four scatter symbols grants 15 free spins, during which every multiplier is added to a growing global value. This accumulation system creates strong potential for high-value wins over multiple rounds. Immersive Visual and Sound Design The imagery of Zeus, lightning, and gemstones blends with orchestral sound effects for a cinematic feel. The energy of every tumble and strike keeps players engaged through both real and demo play. Highlights of powerful features and visual depth Registration Process To begin playing gate of olympus pragmatic play , first visit your chosen online casino and open the Casino or Slots section. Use the search bar to confirm that the game is available in the catalogue. Once verified, click “Register” or “Sign Up.” You will be asked to enter your personal details such as full name, date of birth, residential address, and email. After confirming your email address, proceed to set a secure password and agree to the casino’s terms and conditions. Next, select your preferred currency — NZD is often supported for New Zealand players — and choose a payment method like credit card, POLi, Skrill, or bank transfer. Deposit the desired amount, taking note of any welcome bonuses linked to slot play. Once the account is funded, navigate to Gates-of-Olympus and begin your session. Seamless registration and deposit process for new players During gameplay, winnings accumulate in your player balance, which can be viewed in your account dashboard. When you are ready to withdraw, access the “Cashier” or “Withdraw” section. Choose the same payment method used for your deposit, specify the withdrawal amount, and confirm the transaction. Verification may be required before the first withdrawal — typically by uploading ID and proof of address. After approval, funds are processed within one to three business days depending on the payment provider. Following this process ensures a smooth and secure experience from registration to withdrawal while enjoying the power of Zeus in Gate of Olympus. Why You Need the Demo Version The demo version of Gates-of-Olympus serves as an essential part of the player experience, providing a way to explore the mechanics and excitement of the game without financial commitment. When you play Gates of Olympus free , you experience the same stunning graphics, sound design, and dynamic gameplay that define the full version. The purpose of the demo is not only entertainment but education — allowing players to test the pay-anywhere system, observe how the Tumble feature operates, and witness the thrill of multiplier symbols that can reach up to 500×. For New Zealand players, this mode offers a practical opportunity to understand pacing, volatility, and potential outcomes before wagering real money. It provides a genuine preview of how Zeus’s multipliers and free spin rounds function within actual gameplay conditions, building confidence and familiarity through real-time interaction. Problem? Fullscreen Play for real money Play free Play for real money with 200% bonus Top 3 casinos Another benefit of the demo version lies in its ability to help players develop strategy and comfort with the user interface. New users can explore betting options, spin speeds, and visual settings without pressure, while experienced players can refine their approach to symbol recognition and win patterns. The demo mode mirrors the same mathematics and return-to-player ratio as the paid version, giving it authentic predictive value. It also offers insight into how bonuses are triggered, including the anticipation of four scatter symbols that lead to the 15 Free Spins feature. For those accessing the game from New Zealand, the demo runs directly in-browser on both desktop and mobile, requiring no registration or deposit. This freedom allows uninterrupted exploration of the game’s rhythm, from cascading wins to the climactic lightning strikes of Zeus. In essence, the demo version is a training ground — a perfect environment to experience the full depth of Gates-of-Olympus before engaging in real play, preserving both excitement and responsible gaming balance. Basic Winning Odds Calculator The structure of gates of olympus slots revolves around transparent probability mechanics designed to balance unpredictability with fairness. Each spin on the 6×5 grid follows a mathematical model based on symbol frequency, tumble probability, and multiplier occurrence. The table below outlines the basic odds that influence gameplay outcomes. These values are illustrative averages based on standard volatility and RTP settings (96.50%) used across Pragmatic Play’s certified operators. Transparent odds and return-to-player values explained visually Game Element Approximate Odds \/ Description Base Spin Win Chance Around 1 in 4 spins results in a payout of any size, depending on symbol clustering and the Tumble feature continuing multiple rounds. Multiplier Appearance Multiplier orbs appear in approximately 1 out of every 8 to 10 spins during base play, carrying random values between 2× and 500×. Free Spins Activation (4+ Scatters) The likelihood of triggering the Free Spins feature is roughly 1 in 250 spins, influenced by symbol distribution and bet level. Average Return to Player (RTP) The long-term statistical return is 96.50%, which reflects balanced volatility and high win potential during extended play sessions. Max Win Probability (5,000× Bet) The theoretical chance of achieving the maximum payout is near 1 in 8 million spins, consistent with the high-volatility structure. Basic Strategies for Gates of Olympus Success in the gatesofolympus slot machine depends on timing, risk management, and familiarity with its unique pay-anywhere mechanic. The first strategy focuses on understanding the rhythm of tumbles and multipliers. Since consecutive wins can occur within a single spin, it’s often more effective to play longer sessions with moderate bets rather than short bursts with high stakes. This approach allows the mathematics of the game — particularly the 96.50% RTP and medium-to-high volatility — to balance over time. Observing the frequency of multiplier appearances helps players gauge whether the session is trending toward bonus potential. The second strategy involves preparation for the Free Spins round. The most rewarding moments in the gates of olympus slot happen when multipliers accumulate during free play. Activating the feature with four or more scatters can produce substantial returns if the global multiplier builds across several spins. Players often aim to sustain their balance in base play while waiting for this feature rather than chasing every minor win. Managing bankroll by setting clear betting ranges — such as starting at low values and gradually increasing after small wins — can extend gameplay and improve odds of hitting high-value sequences. Smart tactics to enhance winning consistency Lastly, practicing in demo mode before real wagering allows users to test symbol patterns, tumble cycles, and variance pacing. The design of Gate of Olympus rewards patience and awareness. Each spin carries both chance and opportunity, making strategic consistency the key to experiencing its full divine potential. Safety and Fairness The gates of olympus stake experience is built on certified fairness and international compliance standards. Developed by Pragmatic Play, the game operates under multiple recognized gaming licenses, including those issued by the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA), the United Kingdom Gambling Commission (UKGC), and the Government of Gibraltar. These authorities require rigorous testing and ongoing audits to confirm that all results in the game are generated by a certified Random Number Generator (RNG). This independent system guarantees that every spin outcome is entirely random and cannot be predicted, replicated, or altered by any external party. Certified fairness and verified random outcomes The standard Return to Player (RTP) rate for Gates of Olympus is 96.50% , reflecting a statistically verified long-term payout ratio that aligns with fair play expectations across regulated markets. All RTP data is publicly documented and verified during the licensing process, offering full transparency to players and regulators. Casinos hosting the game have no technical control over its algorithms, as all operational logic is stored and executed on Pragmatic Play’s secure servers. This structure prevents any modification or interference from casino operators, maintaining fairness across every platform where the title is offered. For players in New Zealand, safety is reinforced through encrypted data transmission, responsible gaming tools, and compliance with international privacy standards. Pragmatic Play’s licensing framework, combined with RNG certification, creates an environment of trust where every spin of Gate of Olympus is governed solely by chance and verified mathematics, not by external manipulation or bias. Advantages of Mobile Applications The mobile versions of Gates-of-Olympus deliver the same vibrant gameplay, divine visuals, and precise mechanics that define the original release. Every feature — from cascading tumbles to lightning-charged multipliers — is fully optimised for touch interaction. Players in New Zealand can enjoy smooth gameplay, responsive animations, and quick access to bonuses without compromising quality or speed. The mobile format maintains the 6×5 grid structure and identical RTP rate of 96.50%, ensuring fairness and consistency across all devices.

Promo Codes and Bonus Systems for Gates of Olympus Each online casino may offer its own promotional structure related to slot Gates of Olympus , giving New Zealand players access to unique rewards and opportunities. Some casinos feature welcome packages that include free spins or deposit matches tied exclusively to this title, while others provide ongoing tournaments, loyalty points, or cashback systems that reward consistent play. Promo codes often change periodically and can be applied during registration or before a deposit, activating exclusive benefits designed for this specific game. These offers can vary in value and wagering requirements, meaning that one platform’s promotion may suit casual players, while another might appeal to those seeking extended playtime or higher bonus limits. Unlock exclusive rewards and bonus opportunities Before signing up or depositing funds, it’s essential to examine the details of each promotion carefully. Every casino outlines its terms — including minimum deposits, withdrawal limits, and the exact number of spins or percentage of match bonuses — on its promotional page. Understanding these terms in advance prevents misunderstandings and helps players choose the most suitable bonus system. Some bonuses are designed exclusively for Gates-of-Olympus, meaning the rewards can only be used within this specific game rather than across the entire casino catalogue. Reviewing these conditions allows players to make informed decisions, optimise their balance, and play within their preferred limits. Pragmatic Play encourages responsible participation by advising all users to read casino policies thoroughly before activating bonuses or making their first deposit. FAQ Can the game adjust its difficulty depending on how long I play? No, the game’s difficulty never changes based on session length or player behaviour. Gate of Olympus operates using a certified Random Number Generator (RNG), meaning every spin is independent. The system does not record past activity or adapt its odds. Whether you play for five minutes or several hours, each result follows the same statistical model defined by Pragmatic Play’s licensing standards. Why does the game sometimes produce long periods without big wins? This variation is a natural part of its medium-to-high volatility design. The structure of Gates-of-Olympus focuses on creating occasional large rewards rather than frequent small ones. These fluctuations are part of what makes the game thrilling, as each spin carries the potential for sudden, substantial results. Players are encouraged to manage their balance wisely and view gameplay as entertainment rather than guaranteed progression. Does my device affect my chances of winning? No. Whether playing on a mobile device, tablet, or desktop, the mathematical foundation of the game remains identical. Pragmatic Play’s software is server-based, so performance differences between devices only affect graphics or loading speed — never the actual outcome of spins. This system maintains fairness across all platforms and licensed casinos worldwide.

B R Great food and exceptional service. The crispy pork was tender and crispy. The sizzling spicy chicken was really delicious, it could have been spicier and also too much onion in it. The taste was delicious though. This restaurant in on the expensive side but the portions were really generous. We would definitely go back again to try the rest of the menu. The service was really really good 👌 E R Friends brought us here while we were staying with them nearby, and wow it was great! The Peking Duck is so good, and such a big serve for the price!! And we got some of the crispy pork belly as well, only a \"small\" serve and it was till really big...between 4 of us we couldn't eat it all and took some home! Such a reasonable price for the size of the serves, I would come here again happily! Genevieve Martin Lunch menu starts from $22 per dish. A little pricey but understandable as they serve complimentary Chinese tea and soup and the portions were huge! One dish can actually feed two people but we wanted to try both the roast duck and roast pork. Roast duck was delicious and duck oil coated the rice, making every bite a delight. Roast pork was tender yet had a wonderful crunchy skin. Admittedly, towards the end, it got a bit cloying as it was quite rich but the Chinese tea helped in refreshing our palates. Unexpectedly the restaurant is bigger on the inside and looks like any typical Chinese restaurant. Service was fast (don't blink) - received our food within 15 minutes. Staff were pretty welcoming upon our entry into the restaurant and assisted promptly when we needed anything but otherwise left us to our meal, which we appreciated. They also sell various ingredients at the cashier - chilli oil, peanuts, salted fish, duck wings, duck feet etc. May need a translation tool though. A whole roast duck for takeaway is $50 and they very kindly entertained my request to have the bones separated. Would happily recommend and return. Lena Leong Been coming here for the last 5 years with my family, amazing Chinese food and staff. We always get the roast duck, wat dan beef and vege on rice noodle (滑蛋牛河), yanzhou fried rice, and garlic bok choy. They also serve you tea and a complimentary soup depending on availability and number of people at your table. Every single time the food was great, every time the owner recognized us and chatted happily. It's more on the expensive side, but that's what parents are for. (haha) Addressing some of the 1 star reviews, I see where most of them are coming from. The restaurant staff seeming \"rude\" or \"impolite\" are really just not used to smiling all the time. This may come off as bad service but it's really a matter of cultural differences. Many of the reviews were left over a year ago, sometimes even 5-10 years ago; I assure you that the restaurant, probably having read through all the reviews, has improved drastically. The owners are more than happy to discuss refunds or remake the food if something isn't to your liking. Duck PREV NEXT LOCATION × Average Customer Rating 4 Great food, great friendly service, highly recommend. Had the crispy pork and the spicy sizzling chicken. The crispy pork was juicy and crispy, perfect. The spicy sizzling chicken was well balanced, tender and tasty. We met Hong (his kitchen), he will tailor the food to your spiciness. You also get a free\/complementary pot of green tea. Try Hong’s Kitchen, you will not be disappointed. B R Great food and exceptional service. The crispy pork was tender and crispy. The sizzling spicy chicken was really delicious, it could have been spicier and also too much onion in it. The taste was delicious though. This restaurant in on the expensive side but the portions were really generous. We would definitely go back again to try the rest of the menu.

Aroha Shepherd A good place to eat. The food is overall good and just as good as some of the other food places around that area. The chicken and roast pork is deliciously good. The beef noodle is just as good. The wonton Soup, although no photo that is not too bad, give it a try it's far better than other ones I've tried. Customer service is okay. When dining in the food is nice and hot when served, and I like the complimentary tea, you are served before your meal arrives. That's always a good thing. A good thumbs up for me. G3REVU After all these years this rest is still holding strong. It used to be very expensive but right now $20 a take away meal looks reasonable. If u buy bbq take away alone it’s expensive.

Overall I recommend this place to everyone Hao Staff are super friendly and attentive, will constantly refill your tea when dining in. Cost to portion ratio is very generous.

Mark Braggins The surroundings are austere, but the food is outstanding - if you are a meat eater (they also have a wide rage of vegetarian dishes) I would recommend the Brisket, it has a touch of aniseed, and would be my personal favourite if it wasn't for the Spicy Ribs, they make my jaw lock just thinking about them. The Orange Beef is good and the deep fried Squid is to die for. There wouldn't be a food establishment in Wellington or probably NZ where you can get great food and great service for $20 a dish.

The fried chicken wings were a bit on the salty side for my taste, but still crispy and well-cooked. Overall, a very enjoyable dining experience. Highly recommended! 👍 Wu Simon KC has been around for a very long time and rarely closes. Their food is always consistent and they serve up till quite late in the night. Menu is extensive and you’ll often end up wanting to replace your initial choice as there’s too many to choose from! My favourite is the black pepper pork chop and deep fried squid (which you need to eat while it’s hot). The place is often packed so be ready to do takeaways or hang around till one is available. Toilets are at the back however do be careful as the floor might be a tad slippery. Eugene T This place is an institution. Huge menu but doesn't compromise on quality. Had a short wait for a table at 9pm on a weeknight but its always worth the wait. If there are better spring rolls in Wellington I haven’t had them. Luke Dienes Delicous chinese foods. They can cook 160 different dishes with only 2 chefs. Caters many customers. Many takeaways also. Their dishes are not so expensive. Joselyn Lim I can see why this place is a well-loved institution! Ordered our BBQ pork and rice and mi goreng and the food came out lightning-fast and tasted fantastic. Great value too.

A smallish place tucked into the bottom floor of an apartment. Perfectly cooked traditionally madr food and HEAPS to choose from too. Some of the best I've had outside the mainland hometown. Ant Last I am so glad I believed the other reviews. Clearly prepared using fresh, high quality ingredients, and very tasty indeed. One of the best takeaway meals I have ever had. Mark Braggins The surroundings are austere, but the food is outstanding - if you are a meat eater (they also have a wide rage of vegetarian dishes) I would recommend the Brisket, it has a touch of aniseed, and would be my personal favourite if it wasn't for the Spicy Ribs, they make my jaw lock just thinking about them. The Orange Beef is good and the deep fried Squid is to die for. There wouldn't be a food establishment in Wellington or probably NZ where you can get great food and great service for $20 a dish. I recommend you go with a few friends, select a dish each and share - you won't be disappointed. Patrick Great chinese food cooked very well.

But when I’m successful, nobody will be laughing then! A dung beetle walks into a bar, “is this stool taken?” My girlfriend asked why I never bought her jewellery. To be fair I never knew she was selling jewellery. ‘I get a weird feeling I’ve been here before’, ‘How so?’ ‘My wifi connected automatically’. To all those I gave books to for Christmas.

I usually order the same dishes because I love them so much. fried vegetarian dumplings, sliced cucumber salad with tofu, and vegetarian noodles in soup is one of my favourite ever.🤤 Believe me the staff are super friendly, I like it.💖The chef is such a kind person he even makes the Dragon 🐉 one, which is incredible😻.I appreciate it🫶🏼everything tastes so good honestly. I really appreciate their hard work. If I could give more than 5 stars, I definitely would. You won’t be disappointed if you try this place. I’ll keep coming back with my sister’s for sure! Lots of love. ✨💖🫶🏼 Munira Yusufi We were around the area and wanted to get some dumpling but ended up getting mapo tofu and eggplant dish. They serve generous amounts of white rice and dumplings are abit too dry but with sauce it’s good. Peter Zhang Have eaten in and had delivery for many many years.

Lots of love. ✨💖🫶🏼 Munira Yusufi We were around the area and wanted to get some dumpling but ended up getting mapo tofu and eggplant dish. They serve generous amounts of white rice and dumplings are abit too dry but with sauce it’s good. Peter Zhang Have eaten in and had delivery for many many years.

The highlight of the meal was the roast duck. The meat was incredibly tender, and the skin was perfectly crispy, just the right balance of flavor and texture. The staff were attentive, and made sure we had everything we needed throughout the meal. We didn't have to wait long for our food, and everything came out piping hot and fresh. M R Always busy here. But we were able to get a table without waiting long. They are very efficient and courteous. The food is well prepared, presented, delicious and generous. Price is a bit on the high side but again generous servings. Ordering is a breeze with the QR code system and you know what you are paying for. Just make sure tea charging is for the right number of people. I have to say again they are very efficient! ENKI'S FUN TECHNO STUFF (EnkiTrillionaire) We visited Mr Lobster’s Private Kitchen a few weeks ago with a group of family and friends (there were nine of us). We made a booking in advance and were seated at a large table with a lazy Susan, which made sharing easy. We ordered a range of dishes from the menu—everything sounded amazing, and each dish had its own unique flavour. The standout for us was definitely the Peking duck. The crispy skin, juicy meat, and the combination with the wrap and veggies were just perfect. We also really enjoyed the green beans, roast pork, spicy chicken, and BBQ fried noodles—they were all packed with flavour. The only downside was the slow service. It seemed like dishes were being made and served one table at a time, which is understandable, but with so many other groups there, it meant we waited over 30–40 minutes before the food started arriving. A bit longer than we’re used to, even at busy places. That said, once the food came, it was worth the wait—just something to keep in mind if you're heading there during peak hours. Sang Hyun Kim Probably the best yum cha spot in Auckland! The food quality here is definitely a step above other well-known places. We came for a Saturday brunch with my family and my wife's family, and the place was already busy right from opening at 11am. Every table was full by lunchtime, so I was glad we had made a booking! Ordering was super easy using their QR code system, which showed clear photos of each dish. It was really helpful for choosing what we wanted. We ordered quite a variety, including their popular black truffle dumplings, steamed prawn dumplings, Mr. Lobster deep-fried prawn paste in shredded pastry, deep-fried spicy beans for salad, and a lobster congee to share, along with a few more dishes (not all pictured). Dish highlights: - Black Truffle Dumplings: Absolutely my favourite! There are two versions, and both were rich, fragrant, and full of truffle aroma - a must-try. - Steamed Prawn Dumplings: Fresh, juicy, and perfectly cooked - classic done right. - Deep-Fried Prawn Pastry (Mr. Lobster): Super crispy on the outside and beautifully tender inside. Loved every bite. - Spicy Beans for Salad: Crispy, flavourful, and surprisingly addictive. - Lobster Congee: Smooth, comforting, and generous with lobster - perfect for sharing. Even though the restaurant was packed, the staff were friendly, quick, and attentive. They took the time to answer our questions and made sure we had everything we needed. I have been here a few times now and have never been disappointed. They do yum cha only in lunch time, so it was important to us meeting in lunch time. The only downside is that prices are higher than other yum cha places, but the quality and flavour kinda justify it. Highly recommended, and make sure to book ahead. Michael Kang We have been several times for yum cha and once for dinner. The staff are very friendly and speak English. For yum cha you order on an app which has pictures and is in English and Chinese. They do have a physical menu but encourage to order on the app. There is no trolley service. Food is very tasty and a great variety. Pictures only show the few items we had. Highly recommend yum cha. You must book. The carpark can get busy but u can register your car with the restaurant to avoid getting towed or a ticket. Dinner is also very good with great service.

Cost: $21 The fish was of a good size and coated nicely with a crunchy batter for most of it. Some spots the batter was soft. The flesh was a little rubbery to the bite, so didn’t give off those ‘fresh feels’. The chips were okay and better off in a chip butty, soft and pillowy right through. Corn fritter was ‘gluggy’ due to a batter mix and not the mash potato that’s the way forward! Disappointing really. The sausage was well, exactly as it looked lol. In terms of value, I gotta say it’s not there. Yes for portion size, but a hard No on quality and taste. Mark Panapa A little family run shop with decent prices and large portions. Given the economy these days, the place is definitely a bang for your buck location. Good chinese food and freshly made fish and chips; would highly recommend to anyone looking for an affordably but delicious meal (the kind family that runs the place is just a bonus - seems they just started running the place recently but super nice folks taking over the business)! Anna Li 1st time here wasn't expecting much.. but turned out to be very high standard!! Everything fresh!! Prices are good!! I got the fish burger combo!! And wow!! The fish piece was sticking out from both sides!! Awesome!! Update!! Forgot about the Nasi Goreng!! A must!! Combination awesome 🤙🏾 Rangi Tait Yum yum in our Tum.

Nigiri is always fresh, sushi rolls are always the same top quality, tempura light and crunchy and karaage or teriyaki always superb. Even the rice is fluffy. Highly recommended. Dean Evans I had the pleasure of dining at Nami Japanese Restaurant recently, and it was truly an unforgettable experience. From the moment we stepped in, we were warmly welcomed by the staff, whose kindness and attentiveness made us feel right at home. The food was absolutely outstanding — each dish was beautifully presented and full of fresh, authentic flavour. You can tell that a lot of care goes into the preparation, and the ingredients were of the highest quality. Whether it was the sashimi, the grilled items, or the side dishes, everything tasted incredibly fresh and well-balanced. The service was equally impressive. The staff were friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive without being intrusive. They took the time to explain the menu and offered great recommendations based on our preferences. It’s rare to find such genuine hospitality these days, and it made our time there even more enjoyable. The atmosphere of the restaurant is elegant yet relaxed. The interior design blends modern touches with traditional Japanese elements, creating a peaceful and inviting space. It’s perfect for both casual meals and special occasions. Overall, I cannot recommend Nami highly enough. If you’re looking for a place where excellent food meets top-notch service and a beautiful setting, this is it. I will definitely be returning with friends and family. 오요한 Proprietor is very friendly, although the young man waiting tables definitely didn't want to be there and never bothered to check on us after giving us our food. We tried to order ramen but they were all out, which was odd since it was literally an hour into their first service of the week (Tuesday). Because of this we asked for more time to check the menu and the waiter then took it upon himself to put the single order through for gyōza which we'd mentioned before finding out they were out of ramen, so this came out long before we'd even had a chance to order other appetisers or mains. The wait for the rest of the food was staggered but not too long overall. Wakame salad was perfectly seasoned. The tuna tataki sashimi was not bad but seemed to be from frozen going off the pinkish colour and texture. Soft shell crab was tasty but on the small side for $28. The donburi unagi was very good. All in all not an amazing experience, so I will probably try other local options for Japanese before I return. Jimmy I absolutely love dining at Nami! The food is always fresh and incredibly delicious. The service is beautiful, and Eugene, the owner, is so generous and welcoming. I always leave with a smile. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for an authentic Japanese dining experience! Melissa Gilbertson First visit in this Japanese restaurant in the lunch time. We arrived early and few customers were already inside. This is one of the few authentic Japanese cuisine restaurants in town. As you enter, it seems like you are in Japan, great decorations, long bar featuring traditional customs. Food came quickly, we ordered some chicken karage for our chidren, my wife ordered salmon with salad and me lamen. All tasted fantastically nice, soft rice and well seasoned. Owners are Japanese, that explains much of the quality and precision. Looking for another good experience in the future.

    "homepage_content":"PetBiLocal – My Blog Skip to content Home 26 Sep The Timeless Appeal of Shoes: More Than Just Footwear admin Business No Comments Shoes are far more than something we slip on our feet each morning. They tell stories about who we are, where we’re going, and how we choose to present ourselves to the world. From the earliest leather sandals worn thousands of years ago to today’s designer sneakers that double as status symbols, shoes have always played a vital role in culture, style, and self-expression. The Function and Evolution of Shoes At their core, shoes serve a practical purpose: to protect our feet from the ground, weather, and injury. But over the centuries, they’ve evolved into symbols of identity and markers of social status. In ancient Egypt, the wealthy wore elaborate sandals, while commoners often went barefoot. In medieval Europe, pointed shoes signified nobility. By the 20th century, shoes were a booming industry, blending fashion and function to keep up with rapidly changing lifestyles. Today, shoes are designed with incredible versatility. There are high-performance athletic sneakers engineered with advanced cushioning, sturdy boots crafted to withstand rugged terrains, and elegant heels designed to turn heads at formal events. The choices are endless, and for many people, picking the right pair is both an art and a personal statement. Shoes as an Expression of Style Few fashion items have as much power to transform an outfit as shoes. A simple change from sneakers to loafers, or flats to stilettos, can completely shift the tone of what you’re wearing. Sneakers : Once reserved for sports, sneakers are now a global fashion staple. They’ve crossed cultural lines, pairing as easily with jeans as with dresses or suits. Boots : From rugged hiking boots to sleek ankle boots, this category is versatile enough to work across seasons and styles. Sandals : The ultimate in warm-weather footwear, sandals balance comfort and breathability with casual flair. Heels : Love them or hate them, high heels remain iconic for their ability to elongate the legs and add sophistication to an outfit. Flats : Timeless and practical, flats offer everyday comfort without sacrificing polish. This adaptability makes shoes one of the most expressive accessories in anyone’s wardrobe. The Psychology of Shoes Interestingly, shoes can also reveal quite a bit about personality. Psychologists have noted that the type of shoes someone wears often correlates with aspects of their character or lifestyle. Well-kept, polished shoes : Suggest conscientiousness and attention to detail. Colorful, bold footwear : Often associated with openness and creativity. Worn-out, practical shoes : Reflect practicality and comfort-driven priorities. In many ways, the shoes we choose act as silent introductions before we’ve said a word. Comfort Meets Technology Modern footwear isn’t just about aesthetics. Comfort and performance are now just as important as style. Sports brands invest millions into research and development, creating shoes with shock absorption, breathable fabrics, and ergonomic designs that support long-term foot health. The rise of technology has also introduced smart shoes — footwear with built-in sensors that can track steps, monitor posture, and even connect with apps for fitness tracking. These innovations show just how far shoes have come from their humble beginnings as simple coverings. The Sustainability Shift In recent years, sustainability has become a central topic in fashion, and footwear is no exception. The production of shoes often requires significant resources, from leather tanning to synthetic materials. Many companies are now rethinking their processes, focusing on eco-friendly materials and ethical production methods. Brands are experimenting with recycled plastics, plant-based leathers, and biodegradable fabrics. Consumers, too, are becoming more mindful, looking for shoes that don’t just look good but also align with their values. This shift is not only reshaping the footwear industry but also encouraging shoppers to consider longevity over fast fashion — investing in shoes that last, rather than chasing disposable trends. Collecting Shoes: A Cultural Phenomenon For some, shoes are more than functional or fashionable — they’re collectibles. Sneaker culture, in particular, has exploded worldwide. Limited-edition releases from brands like Nike or Adidas often sell out in minutes, with resellers flipping them at multiples of the retail price. High-fashion brands also contribute to this culture with exclusive drops, collaborations, and statement designs. In many ways, shoes have become cultural currency, representing not just style but also belonging to a community of enthusiasts. The Role of Shoes in Everyday Life While celebrity collaborations and high-fashion designs grab headlines, most people value shoes for how they fit into their everyday lives. The right shoes can make commutes more bearable, workouts more effective, and social occasions more enjoyable. They can also provide confidence — there’s something powerful about stepping out in footwear that feels just right for the occasion. For parents, children’s shoes are a constant consideration as kids grow quickly and need supportive, durable pairs. For professionals, quality dress shoes or heels can play a role in how they are perceived in the workplace. For travelers, lightweight and versatile shoes can mean the difference between an easy trip and sore feet. Buying Shoes in the Digital Age The way we shop for shoes has also transformed. Online platforms have revolutionized accessibility, giving shoppers the ability to browse thousands of styles without leaving home. Detailed product images, size guides, and customer reviews have made it easier than ever to buy confidently online. Retailers like Styletread in Australia have thrived by offering a wide selection of brands, fast delivery, and flexible return options, showing just how much convenience matters to today’s shoppers. The rise of e-commerce has made finding the perfect pair of shoes a process that can take minutes, not hours spent at the mall. Why Shoes Will Always Matter At the end of the day, shoes are far more than objects we wear out of necessity. They are companions on life’s journey, quietly supporting us through milestones both big and small. The pair you wore to your first job interview, the sneakers that carried you through a marathon, or the heels you danced in at a wedding — shoes become part of our personal stories. Fashion trends will continue to evolve, technology will keep advancing, and sustainability will drive new innovations. Yet the essence of shoes — as protectors, statement-makers, and storytellers — will always remain. Final Thoughts Shoes are one of the few items in our lives that balance function and fashion so seamlessly. They carry the weight of our daily lives while offering endless opportunities for self-expression. Whether chosen for comfort, style, or symbolism, shoes remain a universal constant across cultures and generations. As we move into a future shaped by technology and sustainability, our footwear will continue to adapt while retaining its timeless significance. And for shoppers who want choice, convenience, and a touch of style, modern retailers make the process easier than ever — proof that the humble shoe still has plenty of steps left in its journey. 24 Apr The State of Insurance in Australia: Challenges, Trends, and Future Outlook admin Business No Comments Insurance plays a crucial role in Australia’s economy, providing financial protection to individuals, businesses, and communities against unforeseen risks. From home and car insurance to life and health coverage, the industry is a cornerstone of financial security. However, the sector faces significant challenges, including rising premiums, climate change impacts, regulatory changes, and technological disruptions. This article explores the current state of insurance in Australia, key trends shaping the industry, and what the future may hold. The Current Landscape of Insurance in Australia 1. Market Overview Australia’s insurance industry is one of the most developed in the Asia-Pacific region, with a market size exceeding $60 billion annually. The sector is dominated by major players such as: IAG (Insurance Australia Group) – Owners of brands like NRMA, CGU, and RACV. Suncorp – Includes AAMI, GIO, and Apia. QBE – A global insurer with a strong Australian presence. Allianz and Zurich – Major international insurers operating in Australia. The industry is divided into several key segments: General Insurance (home, car, travel) Life Insurance (income protection, death cover) Health Insurance (private health coverage) Specialty Insurance (cyber, business interruption) 2. Rising Premiums and Affordability Concerns One of the biggest challenges facing Australian consumers is the rising cost of insurance premiums. Several factors contribute to this trend: Increased Natural Disasters – Bushfires, floods, and cyclones have led to higher claims, forcing insurers to raise premiums. Inflation and Supply Chain Issues – Rising costs of repairs and replacements impact claims payouts. Reinsurance Costs – Australian insurers rely on global reinsurance markets, which have become more expensive due to global climate risks. A 2023 report by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) found that home insurance premiums rose by an average of 12% in the past year, with some high-risk areas seeing increases of over 50%. 3. Climate Change and Its Impact Australia is one of the most climate-vulnerable developed nations, with insurers paying out billions in claims due to extreme weather events. Key concerns include: Bushfire Risks – The 2019-2020 Black Summer fires cost insurers over $2.3 billion. Flooding – The 2022 Eastern Australia floods resulted in $5.6 billion in insured losses, making them the costliest disaster in Australian history. Cyclone Exposure – Northern Australia faces frequent cyclones, leading to higher premiums in regions like Queensland. Insurers are now reassessing risk models, with some refusing to cover high-risk properties or imposing steep excesses. The government has introduced schemes like Cyclone Reinsurance Pools to help stabilize premiums in disaster-prone areas. 4. Regulatory Changes and Consumer Protections The Australian insurance market is heavily regulated to ensure fairness and solvency. Recent regulatory developments include: The Financial Accountability Regime (FAR) – Strengthens accountability for insurers and executives. The Design and Distribution Obligations (DDO) – Requires insurers to ensure products meet consumer needs. The General Insurance Code of Practice – Sets standards for claims handling and transparency. Additionally, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) monitors pricing practices, particularly in home and car insurance, to prevent unfair pricing. Emerging Trends in the Insurance Sector 1. Digital Transformation and InsurTech Technology is reshaping how insurance is sold and managed in Australia. Key innovations include: AI and Machine Learning – Used for risk assessment, fraud detection, and personalized pricing. Telematics in Car Insurance – Usage-based policies (e.g., pay-as-you-drive) are growing in popularity. Digital Claims Processing – AI-driven chatbots and automated claims systems speed up payouts. Australian InsurTech startups like Cover Genius, Huddle Insurance, and Honey Insurance are disrupting traditional models with digital-first solutions. 2. Cyber Insurance Boom With the rise of cyberattacks, businesses are increasingly seeking cyber insurance. The market is expected to grow by 20% annually, driven by: Increased ransomware attacks. Regulatory requirements for data protection. SME demand for coverage against digital risks. 3. Shift Towards Parametric Insurance Unlike traditional insurance (which pays based on assessed losses), parametric insurance pays out when predefined triggers (e.g., flood levels) are met. This model is gaining traction for agriculture and disaster coverage, offering faster payouts. 4. Health Insurance Challenges Australia’s private health insurance sector is under pressure due to: Rising costs leading to younger people dropping coverage. Government reforms to make policies more affordable. Increased demand for mental health coverage post-pandemic. The Future of Insurance in Australia 1. Greater Focus on Prevention Insurers are investing in predictive analytics and IoT devices (e.g., water leak sensors, fire alarms) to prevent losses rather than just paying claims. 2. Sustainable and ESG-Linked Insurance Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors are becoming critical. Insurers are: Offering discounts for eco-friendly homes. Divesting from fossil fuel-related underwriting. Supporting climate resilience projects. 3. Potential for More Government Intervention As premiums rise, the government may step in with: Subsidies for high-risk areas. Mandatory coverage requirements (e.g., flood insurance). National disaster insurance schemes. To save on your premium with Everyday Insurance, use an Everyday insurance coupon to get a discount on your policy. 4. Customer-Centric Innovations Future trends include: On-demand insurance (e.g., temporary coverage for gadgets or travel). Personalized pricing based on real-time data. Blockchain for transparent claims processing. Conclusion The Australian insurance industry is at a crossroads, balancing rising risks with innovation. While climate change and affordability remain major challenges, digital transformation and new insurance models offer hope for a more resilient future. Consumers should stay informed, compare policies, and consider risk mitigation strategies to navigate this evolving landscape. As the market adapts, collaboration between insurers, regulators, and consumers will be key to ensuring that insurance remains accessible and effective in protecting Australians against an uncertain future. 20 Dec Discover Glassons: A Leading Fashion Destination admin Business No Comments Glassons , a well-known name in the fashion world, has become synonymous with trendy, affordable clothing and accessories.

Brosa had reportedly posted annual sales of over $50 million before it went into administration last week. In addition to its stock and intellectual property, which it will now own, Kogan will also provide support to Brosa’s customers. Founded in 2014, Brosa was able to build a following among high-end consumers. It offers a wide range of home goods, including three-seater white couch and vintage rugs. It was backed by venture capital firms which helped fund the marketing and brand building of Brosa. The valuation of Brosa increased by 49 percent in the past few months due to its solid trading performance. Due to the pandemic, the demand for home goods retailers started to decline. As a result, Brosa was placed in administration. Brosa is in a relatively mature online furniture market that includes similar reatilers such as LivingStyles . You can save at Livingstyles with a LivingStyles coupon . In its filings with the Australian Securities Exchange, online retailer Kogan noted that Brosa was valued at about $60 million. It had also experienced strong revenue growth during the previous financial year. The administrator of Brosa said that the company received over 30 expressions of interest. After considering the various bids, it was decided that the online retailer would purchase the business. It’s a small acquisition for the Kogan, which has a market capitalization of around $350 million. During the September quarter, its gross sales were $202.3 million, which was 38.8 percent lower than the previous year. The acquisition of Brosa was relatively low-risk for both parties. It also allows Kogan to expand their online furniture offerings. 17 Oct Retailers failing to reach their sales goals admin Business No Comments Most retailers failed to meet their sales targets during the first quarter of the year, and more than a third were uncertain if their businesses would survive the next 12 months. The latest Retail Radar report shows that almost half of New Zealand retailers failed to meet their sales targets in Q3. The retail sector was hit by the resurgence of Covid-19 and lockdown in Auckland, which caused sales to fall in August and September. A survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers revealed that almost half of retailers expected sales to fall in the run-up to Christmas. Many of them were also not sure if they would be able to survive another year. Due to government lockdowns and changes in the alert level, many retailers have experienced a significant impact on their operations. Many businesses are complaining about a change in rules that limit what they can sell on level 4. This is leaving them hurting and unable to offer their usual services. Retailers were facing various issues such as a lack of stock and the ability to make rent payments, said Michael Jacobson, head of retail at PricewaterhouseCoopers. Almost half of retailers expect to raise their prices in the next quarter. Retailers wanted the Government to pay them a financial payment for their rent, according to a survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers. According to Retail Radar, the number of retailers who are satisfied with the government’s handling of Covid-19 has plummeted. Almost 70 per cent of retailers were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the government’s response to the Covid-19 report, according to a survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers. Retail NZ asked for measures to help retailers in the next few months, such as establishing a clear date for the Auckland road map, issuing saliva testing for Covid-19 and relieving rent relief. The motion also called for a halt to measures that would increase costs, such as the minimum wage and a moratorium on further increases. Stores like Glassons have continued to perform well with strong sales during Covid.

Places that had a higher risk of transferring the Corona Virus including restaurants, gyms and pubs were forced to shut down. Other stores have chosen to voluntarily shut down due a complete drop in the traffic to these stores. Those employees of these chains that have temporarily shut down versus going out of business have had to look for other means of an income such as the newstart allowance. Two major chains that have recently closed all it’s retail stores are Adairs and Kathmandu . Adairs announced that it would shut all it’s bricks and mortar stores for six weeks to ensure the safety of their customers and staff. Adairs’ New Zealand stores have already closed due to the level 4 restrictions. Kathmandu has also closed all its Australian and New Zealand stores which number 170. They also own Rip Curl stores of which they have closed all 100 of them. They have over 2000 staff in Australia and all will be told that they will be stood down without pay for 4 weeks. They will however be able to use their leave entitlements over this time. Shareholders will also be affected by the virus with a suspension of dividends. If you want to continue shopping at Adairs , visit their online store which is still open. Use an Adairs promo code with your purchase to get a great deal. 05 Nov The top things to see or do in New Zealand’s South Island admin Travel No Comments New Zealand is known as one of the most beautiful countries in the world and there is an amazing amount of sites to see all around the country.

He absolutely loved everything—from the noodles to the xiao long bao to the braised wheat gluten. We’ll definitely be back again! Shane chu The vibe is chilling when I was there since I arrived begining of Thier start working hour. Thier Pu er tea I enjoy it taste so good . Chrysanthemum tea was perfect taste as it for children .Thier dim sum taste good but it quite sad that the skin was too soft that easily broke that lead the juice came off most of the time.seaweed soup dumpling amount was perfect per person ratio.Sausage bun is what I like the most due to the juiciness. The pan fried dumplings was good as it's not too crunchy the skin if you stuff one piece inside the mouth which will not hurt you that much like gyoza Catherine Zeitouni Best and authentic Southeastern Chinese food! Must try the Shanghai style teamed pork bun!!! We also ordered the pork and bamboo root soup, which was very light and fresh. The Chinese pickles with fish fillet tasted great, not too much decoration but it's savoury when you try the pickled cabbages. Also we had the green soya bean with pickles, which was the best companion for rice. Fried pork ribs were crispy and yummy, worth the price. Last, when we left, we had Shanghai style fried fish cold dish as takeaway. But I could not resist the tempt and tried one piece, which brought me back home. Definitely recommend it!!! Hanajan As a Shanghainese myself, I gotta say this restaurant offers the most authentic Shanghai local food in Lower Hutt, if not in Wellington. The fish fillet and the fried rice are amazing. Love them all! Thank you. Cheers~ Ying Min 颖敏 Ren Loved our visit. The 6 of us shared 5 dishes and enjoyed everyone. The two children were treated kindly by the staff.

We ordered four dishes. Jingdu sour sweet pork rib is the best sour sweet fried chicken that I’ve ever tasted. Very crispy skin and very tender meat inside, perfect seasoning. A little sour and sweet. Perfect price and portion. And they also give one bite of free desert. And Chenpi red beans. Tooo sweet.🥰🥰🥰🥰100% recommend. Yarong Duan You won’t go wrong with Regals if you’re after authentic chinese cuisine or a fantastic spread of yum cha. They have a great variety to choose from their menu and are often packed, so do book in advance. Parking is ample around the streets however one inconvenience is the lack of an elevator, which might not be accessible for the elderly etc. I’ve also added some videos from chinese new year where they often have the lion dance performance which is entertaining for all. Eugene T Great restaurant for banquet meals. Also discounts for members. Roast Duck is excellent. Glenny Y Food is fantastic. There's a load to choose from especially the Yum Cha menu 11am to 2.30. I ordered way too much food but it was all fantastic and I got a takeaway container for left overs. Grant Newdick Lots of Cantonese people were here for yum cha, so my expectations were high. While the atmosphere was good, the dishes were mostly not. The har gao was fishy, mixed with bamboo and seemed off. The xiu mai was all tough pork. The xiao long bao was all meat and no soup. Taro pan fried cakes were super dry, and chinese donut rice rolls were flattened with too much soy sauce. The chicken feet were delicious though, the only standout dish. The pan fried chive cakes were alao good. The trolley service was also a bit pushy with some of the orders (like the drink cart and desserts) while having to request core dim sum dishes like har gow was a bit odd.

Everytime when i visit or go pass hamilton i will come and have it. steve yee Homely atmosphere in this small space. Freshest noodles and tofu with authentic Chinese cooking. Worthwhile and a favourite go-to in Hamilton ApitiWhanau After visiting Hamilton Garden on the way back to Auckland our team feel hungry, randomly google a noodle shop and gave it a try. Being an Asian I can tell you this is better than most of noodle shops in Auckland LOL. The shop owner is very nice and offered me extra noodle for free but I shouldn’t be greedy lol Henry Choi Loved the meal. We had a vegetarian noodle soup, mapo tofu and noodle stir fry. We were treated with smiles and respect. It was worth the stop. M. Shomade Hidden pearl next to uni, delicious pork noodles, with tasteful sauce and soft pasta. Owners working all day long, also selling handmade tofu. Place is small and cozy, looks you are eating in their dining room. Dozens of combinations of noodles and ingredients chosen on the spot. Arrived in the lunch time and was quiet and clean, some old ladies were there, giving a good impression of the quality and reputation.

Thankyou, food was delicious I’ll definitely be back 🥰 hays pitman I had a best GF fish and chips from here last week & my partner had the Supreme burger, chips, 2 fish & a sausage. Absolutely delicious. Nice and clean family owned business. Will be back to try more from the Gluten Free Menu. Karen Hibberd My son and I come every week because it has the best hotdogs my son inhales them. Great chips. Service is always efficient and friendly. Love that they have interesting tabletop brain games to play while you wait too. Nikki Aranui Had takeout here twice last week. Best Chinese takeaway we have found in Christchurch yet, by far!!!! Massive containers filled to the brim with food. You can choose it with or without rice and it is only a few dollars more without the rice. We had lemon chicken, sweet and sour pork, chicken fried rice and wontons. It was ample for six people including a teenage boy who has hollow legs! It was amazingly tasty and just delicious. Also what I noticed was not a lot of sauce, but enough to cover each piece of sweet and sour pork or chicken. It wasn’t drenched in it which you find other places. I really liked that. The batter was crispy and hot. The wontons are not the typical shape - they were different but crispy and delicious!!! A lot of meat in them unlike others that are just the wonton wrappers and less than a teaspoon of meat. This had ALOT of meat!! This will now be our go to Chinese and fish and chips shop!!!

Pretty yum! Shumai juicy and lots of prawn. Squid tentacles crispy and flavourful. Waiters speak some English but didn’t seem to want to bring us some stuff we ordered for takeaway? Also no yumcha trolley, they come out on platters. Would go back, pretty equivalent to lobster palace and the other yum Cha place on chapel road. $110 for 3 of us. Rachel They are open quite early for Yum Cha, so it is best to go earlier than at 12pm. Usually there is a bit of a wait, as the restaurant is not big. Most tables are suitable for 4 people, with a few that can sit more. They bring out the food on trays, instead of trolleys and the selection is limited to your more traditional dishes. Still very tasty, but no special dishes William Lin A pretty nice yumcha place with reasonable prices. We went on a public holiday, it was busy but no wait time, we were seated immediately. Everything was good, nothing incredible but was overall tasty. The highlight would be the steamed yellow cake rolls, not too sweet, very fluffy with a little bit of saltiness from the filling in the centre. The bathroom was not very well maintained though. It wasn't disgusting, but only half of the toilets and basins were working, the others just had tape around them. Was about $130 for four adults, which I found ok, considering it was a public holiday. Good place to eat with friends. Just don't all go to the bathroom at once. JJ F Good place for lunch.

Chefs specialising in Chinese-style roast duck are grappling with a dilemma: ditch traditional culinary techniques, or risk prosecution for breaching food safety rules. The rules, set by the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI), âfailed to take traditional Chinese culinary techniques into accountâ, Christchurch chef Cliff Yeung said. Full article ... Dragon Express is a Chinese, dine-in, fully licensed restaurant where Chefs prepare food of the highest quality, to Hong Kong standards of finest dining. I would recommend you come to Dragon Express just to meet the chef and owner, Cliff. He is such a character and always manages to make us laugh and to make his customers feel welcome and at ease with his sense of humour and passion for food. Come to Dragon Express today to enjoy the experience of carefully prepared, beautifully served, Chinese food.

For your peace of mind we have included information on Chinese Dining, and you are welcome to follow these links for more information on: Table manners - Chinese Style Plate, Cup, Chopsticks – the tools of dining and their intended usage Décor –the ancient artwork that graces our restaurant walls At Dragon Express we strongly believe that Chinese dining should be an experience to be enjoyed, and each carefully prepared dish to be discovered and savoured for its uniqueness. This passion led Cliff back to Hong Kong in the early 80’s to complete Chef training, so that he could bring those methods back to his home in New Zealand to be shared and enjoyed by all.

It's a rich and spicy soup with deep layers of flavor. This Central Vietnamese soup is paired with tender slices of beef and pork, then topped with lots of fresh herbs FRIED RICE Stir seasoning liquid and add to fried rice, tossing to coat evenly. Serve fried rice sprinkled with cilantro or mint and dry-roasted peanuts PHO Pho (Phở) originated in the early 20th century in northern Vietnam. It is a Vietnamese soup consisting of broth, bánh phở (rice noodles), simple herbs and vegetables, and meat Menus Our Story Begins In The East Cuisine in this country of 70,000,000 people differs strikingly between the north, south and central regions, but two key features stand out. First, rice plays an essential role in the nation’s diet as it does throughout southeast Asia. But this is also a noodle-crazy population, regularly downing them for breakfast, lunch and dinner, in homes, restaurants and at roadside stands. Noodles are eaten wet and dry, in soup or beside soup, and are made in different shapes and thicknesses of wheat, rice and mung beans. Secondly, no meal is complete without fresh vegetables and herbs. A key portion of every meal, north, south and central, is a platter containing cucumbers, bean threads, slices of hot pepper, and sprigs of basil, coriander, mint and a number of related herbs found principally in southeast Asian markets.

Hubby was quite happy with the food he ate. And son loved his foot (only ate plain inari) We found this was the most expensive sushi train we have been to and pricing didn’t really match the quality of food. Staff were lovely and very accommodating. Easy to get to, with a little side street parking option just a couple of shops away. Mel A This is quality sushi. The dishes are fresh and the price reasonable. The train itself goes very quickly so you have to be a little nimble to grab your dish without making a mess. Good variety and made-to-order items available too. G Mac It wasn't quite pleasant for me as it was my first time I don't know the drinks were self-service while the hostess was quite frustrated on me. Food are so so for me compared with Kazu as my taste bud prefers to have balance on the sushi between the rice and main ingredients . Best part they have your own DIY California roll with a chunk of rice in it. Most of the sushi sizes are quite big with chunk of rice which makes it a little bit pricey compared to Kazu due to the size.but what I like most there is fresh n big size of sashimi. Catherine Zeitouni I am usually not a big fan of sushi but this was awesome. It was my first time going to a restaurant with a sushi train. Everything looked so delicious! They charge by the plate so you basically just grab whatever you like the look of off the train and eat it. They the bill gets totalled up at the end by the number and colour of plates you ate. I was actually surprised at the cost. It wasn't the cheapest around but it definitely wasn't expensive. I felt it was money well spent for the freshness and quality of the sushi. Plus I had so much fun! I ate alot tofu sushi and some karaage chicken. The chicken was to die for! Highly recommend that! And the tofu is a great alternative for those with dietary needs like vegetarian or vegan. There were also other options i noticed; avocado sushi, deep fried tofu and beans. The restaurant is also family friendly. Kids love the sushi train! I saw quite a number of kids and even a new born in the restaurant. The staff are very accommodating and gave fantastic service. They also had a bathroom which was very clean and free lemon water. If you are wanting to park really close, try find a spot on Allen Street. It seems like all the parking in the city is paid. But it only cost us $5 for an hour. Braydon Murphy Not been for years, and recently decided to go back. Great decision too.

The food is always amazing. You have to try the Deep Fried Rice Chicken, the chicken was incredibly moist and tender. Service is great. My only minor note is they don't give free water, which is a bit of a shame, but the food quality keeps this a 5-star spot. Ann Vu From the outside it doesn’t really stand out, but the food is honestly so good and the service is super quick. I tried the beef satay, Hainanese chicken with rice, and combination fried noodle. The beef satay is quite sweet, so maybe skip it if you’re not into sweet dishes. The chicken rice was my fave, a must-try! The spicy sauce that comes with it is sooooo tasty. The noodles were really good too, first time trying and I was impressed. They also have fresh lime juice. Just a heads up, the food smell does stick, so your clothes might carry the scent after, but honestly worth it. Jisoo Kim This has been our go to place for many years and food has always been consistent as the owners have not changed. Our favourites are the deep fried chicken wings, hainanese chicken rice, hokkien char and combination fried noodle. Owners are friendly and are always greeted with a smile.

I ordered the Japanese dinner box and glad that I did. My guest ordered the deluxe set menu (beef steak). The only downside is there's no online menu for dining in, only an online menu for takeaways; which is different to dining in. Great job Yaruki Japanese Restaurant - Henderson Mark Teirney Great place to eat, authentic Japanese feel, price\/product ratio is amazing, definitely recommend Kurtis McCabe What an amazing gem with excellent service and amazing food. The food was authentic and fresh and very well prepared and presented. There is street parking and even thought the restaurant is compact it can cater for heaps. You don’t need to book and can just walk in. Take away is also available but Its nice to sit down and soak in the vibe. Madale de Villiers I highly recommend trying out Yaruki for dinner! When I went, the restaurant was peaceful and the food came out fast. The portion sizes were perfect for the price, and the food tasted amazing. It became busy soon after I arrived, which shows how popular it is. I can't wait to go back again. The place is spotless and the staff are so friendly and welcoming. Augustine Tea Had a meal in Yaruki sometime ago. The restaurant was pleasant and seating was comfortable. Service was friendly and the food was tasty. There was a good selection in their menu. We will definitely be back to try other dishes available. If you love Japanese food you must try Yaruki. Recommended. Tony Wan PREV NEXT LOCATION × Average Customer Rating 4.5 Amazing food, great service, nice atmosphere. I ordered the Japanese dinner box and glad that I did. My guest ordered the deluxe set menu (beef steak). The only downside is there's no online menu for dining in, only an online menu for takeaways; which is different to dining in. Great job Yaruki Japanese Restaurant - Henderson Mark Teirney Great place to eat, authentic Japanese feel, price\/product ratio is amazing, definitely recommend Kurtis McCabe What an amazing gem with excellent service and amazing food. The food was authentic and fresh and very well prepared and presented. There is street parking and even thought the restaurant is compact it can cater for heaps. You don’t need to book and can just walk in. Take away is also available but Its nice to sit down and soak in the vibe. Madale de Villiers I highly recommend trying out Yaruki for dinner!

Recently they delivered fish, sausages and chips for a large group at our bowling club. Everyone was most impressed with the quality and quantity of the food. Fish were large pieces and beautifully cooked. Sausages and chips also very good. I have also had their Chinese meals in the past and they are always beautiful with fresh vegetables and very generous portions. Lynda Wightman I absolutely need my Chinese takeaways time to time in my life and we just moved to Tawa from Wellington city we had no idea where to go etc. one of my closest friends originally from Tawa recommended this place and we went there once then I think we go here at least once a week now.
