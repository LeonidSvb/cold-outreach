Please check our website to learn more about the progress of the house's move to 1508 High Ridge Road. The Hoyt Barnum House is representative of the Second American Building Period, post 1675. The people who built this house were the children or grandchildren of the founders of Stamford. Their tastes and their sense of relation to England were beginning to change and they were becoming more independent. They adopted English architectural styles into a more American mode. Most of the houses in New England – and in Stamford – were built of wood because it was difficult to make mortar to hold stone together without lime, and lime was in short supply in Stamford. The fireplaces and chimneys were put together with clay and hair, or whatever binder could be found for use with the readily available clay. The chimney in the Hoyt-Barnum House is made of field stone and mortar with clay, animal hair, and straw. In building the house, the central chimney was built up to the level of the first floor. Then the house was framed. The framing was done on the ground, the timbers that joined together were marked with matching numerals. To raise the house, a line of men with long poles would push up one side, another line of men would push up the next side. Wooden pins were then used to hold the sides together. Once the framing was the done the owner (Samuel Hait) finished the structure, probably with the help of family members. The house is braced frame construction, (post and beam). The foundation is of stone. The large vertical members are called posts, and the horizontal beams lie on them. The west room of the house is plastered. The east room is whitewashed and the hearth room walls are sheathed with wood paneling, thus showing the various finishing techniques incorporated into the house during it's evolution.

With a campus rich in history and dedicated memorials, take a moment to visit seven sites that pay tribute to the bravery and sacrifice of its veterans. From the solemn echoes of Battell Chapel to the poignant inscriptions of the World War I Memorial Cenotaph, each location serves as a reminder of the enduring legacy of Yale’s military alumni. Battell Chapel Battell Chapel was constructed as Yale’s Civil War Memorial and third student chapel. It contains many tributes to faculty and students, recording their wartime service. Built in the High Victorian Gothic style, with its beautiful stained-glass windows by La Farge and Tiffany, it is the largest house of worship on campus, seating 850. In 1947, the apse was renovated and dedicated to the 16 undergraduate deacons who died in World War II. Joseph Battell donated funds for the chapel’s construction. It was fully renovated in 1984, including the restoration of its Holtkamp pipe organ. Today, the Chapel is used for a variety of religious services and events , including concerts, lectures, and other large gatherings. The annual Naval, Army, and Air Force ROTC Joint Commissioning Ceremony is also held there. Location : 400 College Street Date : 1874-1876 Architect : Russell Sturgis, Jr. (1836-1909) Access : Book an event through the Yale Chaplain’s Office. University Church in Yale holds services at 10:30 a.m. Sundays. World War I Memorial Cenotaph Each year, the university recognizes the service of Yale veterans with a ceremony on Hewitt Quadrangle featuring speakers, tributes, and music. The cenotaph — an empty tomb or monument erected to honor a person or group whose remains are elsewhere — is situated in the quadrangle’s center. This slate and limestone monument is part of the larger Yale Alumni War Memorial, which honors the 227 students and alumni killed in World War I. Standing behind the cenotaph is the classical colonnade. Its entablature is inscribed with the names of the major World War I battles in which American soldiers fought. The massive colonnade, its entablature, and the cenotaph complete the Yale Alumni War Memorial which was funded by alumni donations and dedicated in 1927. Location : 111 Wall Street Date : 1927 Architect : Thomas Hastings (1860-1929) Access : Dawn until dusk David S. Ingalls Rink Yale’s ice rink and hockey arena are named in honor of David S. Ingalls Sr. ’20 and David S. Ingalls Jr. ’56 — former Yale hockey team captains and U.S. Navy veterans. While at Yale, Ingalls Sr. joined the First Yale Unit formed by undergraduates. Their goals were to learn to fly airplanes and develop America’s military aviation — later known as the Naval Air Reserve squadron. All 29 Yale undergraduates from this unit were the first to fly for the U.S. in World War I. Ingalls Sr. became the first ace in U.S. Naval history. He was later appointed as assistant secretary of the Navy in charge of aviation and served throughout World War II, retiring with the rank of rear admiral. The “Yale Whale,” known for its humpback-shaped roof has a capacity of 3,500, was designed by renowned Yale architect Eero Saarinen. Gifts from the Ingalls family provided the bulk of the funding for its construction. The rink hosts the Yale men’s and women’s varsity hockey teams, Yale Club and Intramural Hockey, and university and other skating groups. Location : 73 Sachem Street Date : 1958 Architect : Eero Saarinen ’34 (1910-1961) Access : Yale Men’s Hockey schedule and Yale Women’s Hockey schedule . Institute of Far Eastern Languages During World War II, Yale started the Chinese Language School on campus to teach Mandarin Chinese to U.S. Army officers. By 1947, this evolved into the Institute of Far Eastern Languages (IFEL), whose faculty developed new techniques for learning a spoken language. Known as the Yale Method, it included intensive interaction between students, teachers, and recorded speech. When the Korean War began, IFEL began training U.S. Air Force personnel in Chinese and Korean. Classes in this eight-month program were taught at 215 Park Street. By 1965, the IFEL program had ended, and its courses were folded into Yale’s broader language programs. In 2012, 22 Air Force veterans of the IFEL program visited campus for a reunion, and a plaque was donated to commemorate the program. It is located inside the front entrance of 215 Park Street, the home of the Institute of Far Eastern Languages. Location : 215 Park Street Date : 1947-1965 Memorial Hall The marble walls and bronze plaques of Memorial Hall are inscribed with the names of over 1,000 Yale students and alumni who died in conflicts spanning the American Revolution through the Vietnam War. The tablets that comprise this space were built in stages, and the names of the deceased were added as wars — and their tolls — accumulated over decades. Located in the rotunda of a central entryway to Yale’s Schwarzman Center, Memorial Hall was constructed in 1901 along with Commons, Woolsey Hall, and Woodbridge Hall, to mark the university’s bicentennial. In addition to commemorating the names of the deceased, Memorial Hall notes their class year, military title, and the date and location of death. Beginning in 2015, concurrent renovations to the building that now houses the Schwarzman Center created an opportunity for conserving Memorial Hall’s marble walls, 12 bronze plaques, and four carved sculptures that signify courage, devotion, memory, and peace. Location : 165 Grove Street Date: 1915 Architect : Carrère & Hastings architects (Bicentennial Buildings) Access : Monday – Friday: 8:30 a.m. – 6 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday: 10 a.m. – 6 p.m. American Revolutionary War Paintings by John Trumbull The artist John Trumbull created a group of eight paintings depicting the American Revolution that are on view at the Yale University Art Gallery. These include “ The Battle of Bunker’s Hill, June 17, 1775 ,” which Trumbull witnessed from afar, and “ The Surrender of Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown, October 19, 1781 ,” which marked the end of the war. Perhaps the most iconic scene, however, is Trumbull’s “ The Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776 ,” also on view at the Gallery. Trumbull served briefly as George Washington’s second aide-de-camp during the Revolutionary War, rising to the rank of Colonel. After the war, he was commissioned by the city of Charleston, South Carolina, to paint a full-length portrait of General George Washington at Trenton , also on display at the Gallery. The artist’s father, Jonathan Trumbull, was the last colonial governor of Connecticut and the namesake of Yale’s Trumbull College. Location : Yale University Art Gallery, 1111 Chapel Street Artist : John Trumbull (1756-1843) Access : Tuesday through Sunday: check for hours of operation . Sketch Model of a Soldier’s Head for the Robert Gould Shaw and the Massachusetts Fifty-Fourth Regiment Memorial During the 14 years that artist Augustus Saint-Gaudens spent creating The Robert Gould Shaw and Massachusetts 54th Regiment Memorial , he made many sketches and studies. Four bronze casts from the artist’s plaster studies of Black soldiers’ heads can be seen at the Yale University Art Gallery. Saint-Gaudens based these likenesses on men of military age whom he hired as models. The studies present the individuality he sought for the figures in the sculpture, which includes soldiers ranging from a young drummer boy to middle-aged men. That distinctiveness is sustained in the final Civil War memorial that stands on Boston Common. It commemorates the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment, one of the first Black regiments to serve in the Civil War. Location : Yale University Art Gallery, 1111 Chapel Street Artist : Augustus Saint-Gaudens (1848–1907, Hon. 1905) Access : Tuesday through Sunday: check for hours of operation . Honoring Veterans In November, Yale recognizes U.S. military veterans and their families for their service and support. A Veterans Day ceremony will be held at noon on Monday, November 11, on Hewitt Quadrangle (rain location Woolsey Hall). Explore Honoring Veterans for additional information and related events.

    "homepage_content":"Alice Hardie Stevens Center and East Lawn — Laramie Plains Museum 0 Expanded in 2018, the Alice Hardie Stevens Center is now a jewel of a venue in Laramie. Perfect for meetings, receptions, weddings, anniversary celebrations, parties, and other special events. We can help with any of your partying needs. Alice Hardie Stevens Center The Alice Hardie Stevens Event Center, named for the woman responsible for spearheading the drive to save the Ivinson Mansion from demolition, was built in the early 1920s as a gymnasium and dorm for use by the Jane Ivinson School for Girls. It is owned and operated by the Laramie Plains Museum and provides much of the revenues needed for Museum operations. Used mainly for wedding and anniversary receptions, classes, special parties and other community events, it may be rented by itself or as part of a package with our other rental facilities. The Center is a large room with a beautiful wood floor and grand production stage, lovely French doors that open to lush lawns, and a full catering kitchen. There are four public bathrooms and a lovely bridal dressing room with an attached bathroom that is handy for the bride and her attendants to exit for a wedding on the Museum's east lawn (and have her trousseau in a private space at wedding time). The Center is handicap accessible with parking available close to the facility. The kitchen has two stoves with ovens, 2 microwaves, an industrial-size refrigerator plus a large freezer, 2 sink prep areas, and a compact sanitizer. Some coffee cups, saucers, plates, and other assorted items are stored in the kitchen for incidental use, but check on these items before you plan to use them, as the items are limited in number. 100, 50, and 32-cup coffee urns are available. (No catering services are provided by the Laramie Plains Museum, but most of the caterers in Laramie know our kitchen and are pleased with its facilities.) The Center has 12, 8' rectangle tables (30\" wide); 10, 6' rectangle tables (30\" wide); 25 60\" round tables which can seat 8 guests each; 8 48\" square card tables; 4 high top cocktail tables and 4 smaller cocktail tables; 9 71\" round tables which can seat 10 guests each; and 250 Chavari chairs are also included. The lawn north of the Center comes with your rental. We have 250 white metal and plastic folding chairs that may be used outside. Please be aware that this is a residential area and you will be responsible for keeping the noise to a reasonable level, especially after 10:00 p.m. There are decorating restrictions (i.e. no tape on walls or confetti guns) because of the historic nature of the structure. These are detailed on the AHSC rental contract (available from the Laramie Plains Museum office). As the Alice Hardie Stevens Event Center is one of the most popular reception halls in Laramie, we suggest getting your date locked in as early as possible! Please call to inquire about pricing. East Lawn The lush lawn on the grounds of the Laramie Plains Museum is available for private functions including weddings, receptions, fund-raisers, rendezvous, antique car shows, and many other gatherings. If you choose to rent both this East Lawn & the Alice Hardie Stevens Center, we offer a reduced \"package rate.\" The area available is a full quarter of the Ivinson block. It is manicured lawn surrounded by Victorian gardens and large trees. Buildings on the grounds are not accessible for the party unless you have made arrangements with the Museum staff. 250 white folding chairs and a black iron arch are available for your use. Tables are available for an additional fee. Lawn games such as corn hole or croquet are welcomed! Reservations Reservations are made on a first come, first served basis by calling the Laramie Plains Museum or visiting the Carriage House office located to the rear of the Ivinson Mansion property. Rental dates, particularly for summer weekends, around the holidays, or for area graduations, fill up quickly and far in advance. Do not delay once you have decided to use our facilities for your special event. Photographs In The Mansion Even if your wedding is not occurring in the Ivinson Mansion, the beautiful Victorian interior may serve to provide a special and unique setting for your photo remembrances. Arrangements must be made with the museum staff so that the Mansion is open for your pictures and so that tours of the museum will not infringe upon your photo session. You and your photographer must be aware of the restrictions and care that must be taken with the historic furnishings and interior. Refundable Security Deposit Your deposit serves several purposes: to secure the date, to cover damages that may have occurred during your rental use. If the facility is left in good condition, your deposit will be returned by mail as soon as possible after your event. Since deposits have been set at very fair rates, renters agree to be responsible for any damages occurring to the historic buildings, grounds, or artifacts that exceed the deposit. If circumstances arise that cause you to not use the facility after a deposit has been made, it will be refunded by mail if at least 10 days notice has been given. Last minute cancellations mean that the non-profit museum has lost out on other rental revenue while holding the facility for you. Any withheld deposit may be deemed as reasonable compensation for such loss. Rental Brochure. For pricing, amenities, and more information, check out our rental brochure.

Off season use : During off hours and the off-season the park is typically not staffed, comfort stations are not available and gates may be closed. The off-season poses unique risks inherent when participating in outdoor recreational activities. Recreationists should possess the necessary knowledge, skill, and equipment to ensure their own safety. Users assume all risk while recreating in State Park lands. Activities and amenities About the Park The Daniel Webster Birthplace is associated with the birth and early childhood years of Daniel Webster, one of our country's most respected orators and statesmen. While the site affords a view of the early years of Daniel Webster, it also provides a glimpse of 1700s farm life in the infant years of the United States. At a bend in the road, crossing over a small brook, the two-room log cabin cabin sits in a clearing on a slight hill. Even today the property is quiet and secluded giving the sense that not much has changed. Exploring the area it is easy to imagine what was like growing up in the late 1700’s.

Donate Uncover Goffstown Historical Society's past Our Story The Goffstown Historical Society was organized November 16, 1969, and incorporated on November 19, 1970. The Parker Building, housing the Museum of the Goffstown Historical Society, was used by William Parker in 1804 as a general store and carried on the business until his death in 1839. He was succeeded by his sons, John M. and David A. Parker who continued the mercantile business as the J.M. and D.A. Parker Depot Store until 1872. Goffstown West Village was developing as an economic, political and social center, so the brothers moved the general store easterly to the village area. Parker Brothers’ Store continued in business on Main Street In Goffstown, under the brothers and their descendants until the 1960’s. The Depot Store building, at Parker’s Station, was used for storage and provide housing for the Parker farm workers and to provide accommodations for occasional drovers and loggers traveling on business. After Mrs. John E. Parker organized the Neighborly Club, a literary and social group of ladies in the Parker Station area, the building served as their club house. The ladies supported and maintained the building by serving public suppers, hosting the annual lawn party and summer concert, an event which was eagerly awaited by the entire Goffstown community. In addition, the building was rented out to community members for large scale social functions as a further means of gaining funds. By the mid 1960’s, the maintenance of the entire building created too great a strain on the dwindling membership and financial means of the Neighborly Club and the club house reverted to the John E. Parker family. John E. Parker, working through his daughter, Ruth Parker Henk, contacted the Goffstown Historical Society to see if the Society would be interested in the building as a Society headquarters and museum. In 1974, the Parker Building was dedicated as the Goffstown Historical Society. In 1980, the Parker Building of the Goffstown Historical Society was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Du Bois, and Malcolm X. Participants will explore how oratory served as both a survival strategy and a weapon of resistance, affirming African American speech as a vital force for social change. February 8, 2026 \"The Balm in Gilead\", Black Preacher as Orator | EWH Tea Talks 2026 #2 Sunday, February 8 | 2:00 PM | Portsmouth Public Library | Portsmouth, NH The Black preacher has long held a sacred and central role in African American public speech. Beyond their role as religious leaders, preachers have historically served as political voices, cultural transmitters, community organizers, and skilled rhetoricians.

Website Sign In You are here: Home Visitors History of the Town Historic Structures Covered Bridge Over the Nashua River Covered Bridge Over the Nashua River That place on the Nashua River now spanned by the covered bridge has been host to a bridge since about 1740. Even a brief history of a bridge at that river crossing must include a particular event that took place there just a couple of days after the British regulars marched into Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. Pepperell, Groton and Hollis Minutemen responded to that call by the dozens leaving their wives, mothers and sisters to deal with the children, the farms and any situation that might arise. One Pepperell woman, Prudence Cummings Wright, had been raised in a household that freely discussed politics and not all shared the same opinions. Prudence was a Patriot, inside and out while her brother Samuel was a Tory, loyal to the King. By 1775 Prudence was 35 years old, had been married 14 years and mother to 6 living children. While visiting her mother in Hollis, she overheard her brother and his Tory cohort, Benjamin Whiting, discuss a plan to deliver a message to British regulars revealing the location of gunpowder hidden by the rebel Patriots. In short time she was back in Pepperell sending an alert out to other women within that network now committed to active rebellion. The women quickly reacted. It was decided to stop the Tory spies at Jewett's Bridge, present location of the covered bridge. They gathered together armaments available, probably not guns because those weapons had gone with the men; but farm tools can be threatening weapons. Then they waited at the bridge, into the night, shielding the lantern, totally silent until two horsemen approached from the north. Taking advantage of surprise Prudence burst upon them with lantern bright demanding to know their identity and business. Her brother Samuel knew the depth of his sister's commitment to the cause and immediately turned tail avoiding possible fatal injury. Leonard Whiting pushed forward, believing he couldn't be stopped by a bunch of women. He was wrong of course. Both were dragged off their mounts and searched. Dispatches intended for the British were found. The men were escorted to Solomon Roger's tavern. There the prisoners were detained for the rest of night before being taken to Groton and the Committee of Safety in the morning. About 70 years later at an 1845 town meeting it was voted to build a new bridge at this location \"like the one in Hollis placed over the Nashua River called Runnell's Bridge.\" This was a covered bridge. Captain Levi Parker was chosen to build the covered bridge for which he was to be paid $1200 plus he would be given the old bridge. The Bridge Committee believing the existing piers to be sound did not contract for their replacement. The Town Meeting apparently meant the bridge to be exactly like Runnell's Bridge even though that bridge cost $2,200 to construct, $1,000 more than paid to Parker. The Bridge Committee believing the existing piers to be sound did not contract for their replacement. At a Town Meeting after the bridge was completed the Bridge Committee reported in detail how the Pepperell bridge was inferior to the Hollis bridge, citing items such as floor timber dimensions (6 inch by 12 inch in Hollis laid six feet apart with two braces between each space, Parker used 4 by 12 inch timber laid 3 Â½ feet apart) and Parker's carpentry was inferior. Parker's roof was superior to Runnell's in that he used chestnut shingles on both slopes while Runnell's south slope was pine and just the north side chestnut. Captain Parker was also required to warranty the bridge for ten years for which he was paid one dollar per year. In 1858 Capt. Parker's warranty ended. November 2nd of that year the Selectmen informed the town that Capt Lem'l Parker claimed the pier now under said bridge, as his property, but he would let it remain for the sum of fifty dollars being paid him therefore, otherwise he intended to remove it.\" Capt Parker explained that as he guaranteed the bridge to be safe, he added a pier \"for his own benefit as a security for his guarantee.\" The record indicates that the tenor of the meeting went negative with references to the difficulty that occurred when the bridge was built and the \"trickery that developed itself in the whole affair from beginning to end.\" After several speeches, a motion was made to instruct the Selectmen to build a new pier if they could not settle with Capt. Parker for the old one, passed in the affirmative.\" The bridge was maintained and modified over the years retaining its status as the only Massachusetts covered bridge east of the Connecticut River. By 1950 one hundred years of wear on the bridge foundation required the weight limit be posted at 4 tons, down from the previous 10 ton limit. Soon the bridge was closed to truck traffic and in 1958 it was closed to traffic. State Representative Chester Waterous, for whom this bridge was named, and many others are credited with the replacement of another, much wider, covered bridge. It was dedicated November 4, 1963. The Chester Waterous Bridge closed to vehicular traffic on April 7th 2008 and demolition began to make way for a new covered bridge. The new replacement bridge re-opened on July 30th 2010. 95 feet in length and 47 feet wide, it contains 1,800 pieces of glued wood laminate, 700 pieces of solid timber and 42,000 pieces of hardware, weighing 475,000 pounds. The historic Pepperell Covered Bridge is one of only three covered bridges on public Massachusetts roads that is open to vehicular traffic and the closest to the greater Boston area. Susan J.

About Us About the Markesan Historical Society and the Grand River Valley Museum The quiet, Midwestern town of Markesan, Wisconsin houses a well-kept secret and maybe even a few closet skeletons. Few people know about the Mackford Murder or the missing gold shipment lost on its way to Green Bay. Fewer still realize that Markesan once manufactured washing machines or baseball bats. These and many other “skeletons” can be discovered at the Grand River Valley Museum located at 214 E. John St. in Markesan, WI. The museum opened its doors to the public in August 1991 and is open every Saturday May 1st through September 30th, from 1pm to 4pm or anytime by appointment. For more information, call the museum at 920\/398-3945 or helpful members at 920\/398-3344 or 920\/398-3359. The complex has handicapped-accessible rest rooms, parking and displays. Four separate buildings comprise the museum complex. The main building was donated by Mildred Draeger in memory of her husband, Edward. Inside are separate rooms showing how people lived in the early 1900's. Tools of the shoe-makers, doctors, dentists, haberdashers, trappers and bankers can be seen. The church room shows the history of area churches. This building also houses the original Utley Depot which served the thriving community of Utley with its almost 300 souls. The Markesan train depot dates from the early 1880's and stands to the west of the main building. The depot contains a one room school house which is dedicated to the memory of Leona Weber, one of the founding members of the Markesan Historical Society. The depot agent’s office houses railroad memorabilia as well as a working telegraph. The loading dock houses a milk bottle collection and equipment used in the growing and harvesting of potatoes. To the east is The Arthur Jahns Memorial Agricultural Museum or “Barn” as it’s fondly called; a 58' X 150' building housing many of the machines and implements used in farming when horses still provided the horse-power. Displays also include a blacksmith and harness shop, milking equipment and transportation of the past. This new addition was made possible by a bequest from Arthur Jahns and greatly enhances the offerings of the museum since Markesan’s heritage has its roots in agriculture. The newest addition to the complex is the Walter O. Kienas Building at 223 E. John St., which is across the street from the rest of the complex. This building houses the archives and also serves as storage for any artifacts not on display. An annual cemetery walk is scheduled for Memorial Day each year following the program and roll call at the Markesan Cemetery. Join us as we visit the veterans who have been laid to rest in one of the area cemeteries. The Kienas Building Markesan residents may remember the site where the Kienas Building now sits as a blacksmith shop, owned by Herman Butenhoff in 1899. The business consisted of shoeing horses, carriage building, and repairs to buggies and farm wagons. The business was later operated by Herman’s son, William. The building was purchased by Walter O. Kienas in 1957, who razed the blacksmith shop and erected the current building. Mr. Kienas not only owned the building but the property behind it where he operated an apple orchard and greenhouse. The building was used to store apples from the orchard. In 1987, after the death of Mr. Kienas, his wife, Mary, sold the building to the Grand River Co-op until its purchase by Landmark in 2007. Landmark moved its headquarters from the building, selling it to the Markesan Historical Society in 2018. The Walter O. Kienas Building now houses the Grand River Museum archives, consisting of cemetery records, obituary and wedding notices, school records and high school annuals, photographs, genealogies and other pertinent Markesan information.

We greatly appreciate your help! A Brief History of Isle la Motte Isle La Motte is the northern most inhabited island in Lake Champlain. During pre-European time it was likely a gathering place for Native American Nations that utilized the Lake. In 1609, Isle La Motte was the first landing place of Samuel de Champlain. In 1968, the State of Vermont donated a statue of the French explorer, Samuel de Champlain that is prominently displayed at the site. The sculpture F.L. Weber created the monument for the Montreal 1968 Expo. In 1664, the Island’s world-famous Isle La Motte Black Limestone Reef Complex began to be quarried for lime burning to make ‘quicklime’. The likely major use of this quicklime on Isle La Motte was to make cement for construction. This quarrying activity likely ceased in the early 1670s. Vermont’s First European Settlement, Fort Ste Anne, was built on the northwest shore of Isle La Motte in 1666 by French soldiers under the command of Captain Sieur de La Motte of the Carignan. The fortress itself was a simple structure measuring about 144′ x 96′ with double log palisade 15′ high and four log bastions. Fort Ste. Anne was the staging area for several military expeditions by the French against the British and the Mohawk Nations. In September 1666, about 600 veteran troops of the Carignan-Salieres regt., together with an equal number of volunteers, (or habitans) met here with approximately 100 Huron warriors, prior to marching against Iroquois villages. About three hundred bateaux and bark canoes set off from the Fort on this expedition. Fort Ste. Anne was undoubtedly a fearsome place to be stationed. Situated in the deepest reaches of an impenetrable wilderness, accessible only by water, subject to fierce winds and deep snows, the few hardy souls who resided there likely suffered terribly from both the elements, disease, isolation and loneliness. The fort was abandoned in 1671. All traces of the wooden fort were obliterated by the mid-1800s. The summer of 2016 is the 350 anniversary of the establishment of Fort Ste. Anne. During the American Revolution Northern Campaign Invasion of Canada in 1775, General Richard Montgomery troops camped on the Island as did forces from General John Burgoyne’s invasion army in 1777. In the days preceding the Battle of Valcour, Benedict Arnold’s fleet anchored off the shore. The Town of Isle La Motte was chartered in 1779. It was primarily a farming community. The quarry business began again in 1788 to provide furnishing building stone from at least 3 sites located south of the Town center along the shore (1 on the west shore and 2 on the east). (good photo on http:\/\/www.fiskfarm.com\/fiskfarm\/Historic_Fisk_Farm.html ) There are many ‘test pits’ visible from the roadside or when walking in Isle La Motte’s mixed tree forests. During their operation the quarries were one of the main employers in the Town and all 7 stone buildings are composed of this rock. The quarry blocks were marketed as “Fisk black” or “Fisk gray,” and now can be purchased under the name commercially sold as “French gray” or “Champlain black”. Most of the quarrying operations stopped in the mid-1960s. When you visit the Historic Society Campus look at the outside walls of the Stone Schoolhouse and count how many of the 480 million year old fossilized creatures you can see. In 1802 the town’s name was changed from Isle La Motte to Vineyard. The official records give no indication of the rationale behind the change. Generally speaking, throughout the United States, the name Vineyard has been used in places that either had large numbers of grapes vines (true on Isle La Motte as you can see from the 3 established vineyards on the Island) or the community wanted to be known as grape growing areas. Whatever the reason, the change was not a permanent one and in 1830 the name was changed back to Isle La Motte. During the War of 1812, the British Capt. Daniel Pring erected a battery of three long 18-pdr guns on the west shore of the Island to protect Chazy Landing, NY on the opposite shore. The British Captain George Downie fleet anchored offshore the west side of the island prior to sailing to their defeat by the American’s at Cumberland Bay on September 11, 1814. It was here on Isle la Motte, at the Fisk Farm, in September 1901 that Vice President Theodore Roosevelt heard the news that President McKinley had been assassinated. Roosevelt, staying with the prominent Fisk family, was guest at a Vermont Fish and Game League dinner. The Champlain Tercentenary Celebrations occurred in 1909 at the site of the old Fort Ste. Anne. A large Indian ‘pageants’ was staged, and visiting dignitaries from near and far came to celebrate the great French explorer who gave his name to the lake.

PUBLIC STATEMENT The history of Scotts Hill, Pender County, North Carolina is reflected in this historic site. History is always moving, and continues to shape how we move forward as an historic site. Black history is American history. The G ullah Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor Commission (GGCHCC), of which Poplar Grove is a part, recognizes that “Historic sites carry potent literal and symbolic messages across generations. We (GGCHCC) encourage you to visit them and ask yourself important questions about the history they share and the stories that are left out.” What stories will Poplar Grove carry forward? Part of Poplar Grove’s mission is to initiate meaningful dialogue that builds upon the values of respect, empathy, cultural diversity, multiple perspectives, and democratic principles, especially as it relates to the history of the northeast branch of the Cape Fear River and Topsail Sound in the production of naval stores, indigo, peanuts, sweet potatoes, and melons. We will be expanding our exhibits and tour text to include Poplar Grove’s Revolutionary War history through the lens of a collective and shared experience – locally, nationally, globally, spiritually. Poplar Grove Foundation, Inc., January 1, 2024 EXPLORE HISTORY: EXPLORE THE WORLD Located in southeastern North Carolina and within the National Park Service’s Gullah Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor , Poplar Grove historic house and museum, formerly a sweet potato and peanut plantation, produced peanuts from the agricultural skills of the Gullah Geechee people. The sweet potatoes and peanuts were sold locally to planter families to supplement the diet of the enslaved community. The highly protein-packed food source crossed racial lines during the Civil War to feed both Union and Confederate troops, and in the last decade of the 19th century, Wilmington peanuts were shipped as far north as New York City before P.T. Barnum’s traveling circus would popularize this Gullah crop to the masses. Winter Bedroom The museum complex is sustained through the continuing efforts of Poplar Grove Foundation, Inc., a 501(c)(3) non-profit Public Charity, dedicated to education, conservation, and preservation. The current manor house was restored and opened to the public as a museum in 1980 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places . The 15+ remaining acres left of the original homestead are under the stewardship of the North Carolina Coastal Land Trust . Poplar Grove Foundation, Inc. seeks to shed light on this pre-Revolutionary War planter family who originally settled in New Bern, NC, from Baltimore, Maryland circa 1760. Foy family members and those people this family enslaved played an integral part in eastern North Carolina’s agricultural development and actively participated in North Carolina’s Revolutionary War. The land, and its original manor house, mill pond, brick kiln, and out buildings, was purchased in 1795 by James Foy, Jr. of New Bern, NC, from the estate of Cornelius Harnett, a leading Revolutionary North Carolinian politician. After the original homestead burned circa 1849, Joseph Mumford Foy, the grandson of James Foy, Jr., chose to construct his new home closer to the Old New Bern Road, which would later become the Wilmington and Topsail Sound Plank Road. The current manor house was built circa 1850, constructed and maintained by the skills of enslaved men and women within the Foy family as well as from enslaved male artisans of neighboring planter families, such as Nicholas Nixon of Porters Neck, David Ward Simmons of New Bern, NC, and the Doziers of Brittons Neck, SC. The family ties of the Foys and those families kept in bondage remained tightly woven between and among and through multiple generations of white Foy family descendants and those families of the enslaved. To keep accumulated wealth within geographical and agricultural patterns, southeastern NC planters made a practice of marrying sons and daughters to neighboring planters with similar crop valuations. Routinely, newlyweds of planter families were provided a dowry of enslaved people from respective families, so the younger newly apprenticed and oftentimes oldest members of the enslaved could more readily establish new households and assume the agricultural duties of a gifted portion of the estate. Leading up to Abraham Lincoln’s presidential nomination for the Republican Party, Joseph Mumford Foy held fast to his Unionist ties, the foundation of which were built upon the family’s active participation and service during the Revolutionary War. While North Carolinian planters hotly debated the role of the Federal government in determining the emancipation of enslaved Americans, parts of the South were already discussing succession. After Ft. Sumter, South Carolina was fired upon by Confederate militia on April 12, 1861, North Carolina was the last Southern state to join the Confederacy on May 1, 1861. I n the October 2013 issue of Our State , Burial and Mourning at Poplar Grove by Philip Gerard, highlights the role of Joseph Mumford Foy’s wife, Mary Ann Simmons Foy during the Civil War. Her Unionist allegiance in honor of her dead husband and in service to her nation stood steadfast in the face of opposing forces. Her recently deceased husband had declared “Union forever” in a letter to their eldest son, David, during the fall Presidential election campaign of Abraham Lincoln, a contradiction of political and social ideas among the coastal planters who owned slaves but had strong ties to the Revolutionary War. Slave Schedule of Joseph Mumford Foy August 1860 Topsail Sound Notably, the enslaved people of the Foy family as well as the enslaved communities of neighboring planters knew intimately the shoreline, creeks, swamps, riverbeds and estuaries of the Cape Fear, and thus excellent pilots, boatmen and fishermen. However, the skills and talents of the enslaved people of Poplar Grove are best reflected in the successful cultivation of peanuts and sweet potatoes in the sandy loamy coastal soil, and though rarely recognized, were the engineering and artisan skills of the enslaved males who constructed the current manor house from on-site materials circa 1850-1853. The mill pond that still lies within the Abbey Nature Preserve and accessed by the original farm road that cut through the fields help to produce most of the construction materials. From foundation to rooftop to the interior of the home’s horsehair plaster walls & crown molding to the heart pine floors and black walnut staircase, the three-story manor house stands today as a testament to these little recognized individuals who, like the neighboring plantations along the coastal highway of North Carolina, are part of the Gullah Geechee Corridor with its revolutionary roots leading up to Civil War through the Wilmington Race Massacre of 1898, the Jim Crow Movement of the early 20th century and the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 60s. Within the museum complex is the original smokehouse, kitchen shed, carriage house, and the last remaining tenant house belonging to Nimrod Nixon, whose brother Cleveland Nixon is pictured at the top left of this page. Nimrod Nixon served in WWII, at the same time his employer son’s, Robert Lee Foy, Jr., served. Mr. Nixon returned to Poplar Grove after the war and lived in the surviving tenant house without running water and electricity until the late 1950s when Robert Lee Foy, Jr. inherited the farm lands, outbuildings and manor house of Poplar Grove from his father, Robert Lee Foy, Sr. Three heritage art studios are on site for viewing: the Basket Gallery, the Print Shop and Blacksmith Shop, in addition to an Agricultural Exhibit housing a peanut thrasher and information on the production of peanuts and the Gullah Geechee peoples. This space is currently being expanded to include more specific information regarding the tenant families whom remained on site through WWII. The Foundation would like to thank Dr. Kimberly Sherman, consulting historian, for conducting early research and providing historical and political context to the Foy family archives located both on the property and in the Robert Lee Foy Collection at the Joyner Library at East Carolina University as well as Beverly Smalls, Bertha Todd, and Karene Manley for their invaluable input, and the ongoing research of the enslaved and their descendants by Caroline C. Lewis, Executive Director. We are honored to exhibit, From Civil War to Civil Rights: The African American Experience at Poplar Grove , which opened on June 19, 2014. This permanent display is free to the public and located in the lower level of the Manor House. The project was made possible in part by funding from the North Carolina Humanities Council , a statewide non-profit and affiliate of the National Endowment for the Humanities .

    "homepage_content":"Sussex-Lisbon Area Historium Sussex Lisbon Area Museum [originally called the Depot Museum, later the Fred H. Keller History Museum] came into being after Sussex Village Historian Fred Keller sent a February 2001 letter to the Village Board, stating that he wanted to donate his collection of area history items. He stipulated that a historical society had to be formed, and said he hoped that a local museum would be purchased sometime. After members of the local communities met, the Sussex-Lisbon Area Historical Society, Inc., or SLAHS, was formed, and immediately sought a suitable location to be used as a museum to hold and exhibit Fred’s massive collection, which started back in 1946 when he was only 14 years old.

The Museum is building a collection of Wisconsin based recording studios and their vinyl record labels. This collection will expand to include cassettes, CD's and digital audio media. < > Pioneer For over 70 plus years, historian Fred Keller has accumulated many artifacts of farm, business, and family life in the local area. There is something for everyone, including tools to shave a hogs hair off. < > Native American The Sussex-Lisbon-Lannon area has a rich Native American history that is once again being explored. Our projectile point [spear points and arrowheads] collections are growing. Come see early stone tools found locally, 1950s Wisconsin Dells memorabilia, and the efforts of a Boy Scout in the late 1940s who crafted an Indian dress and tools to earn his Eagle Scout award. < > Railroad Our area had three major railway lines coming thru the area, beginning in the early 1880s, with the third one completed in 1911. See Milwaukee Road [now the famous Bug Line], Chicago & North Western, and Wisconsin Central aka SOO Line memorabilia and history. < > Fossils Our Museum is fortunate to house a collection of fossils found in local quarry mining operations. Recently other fossils have been discovered in farmers' rock piles from the time when the area was covered by warm salt water sea. < > Local Notable Women Local women were often times ignored for their accomplishments in life; not so any more in our area. Two women are chosen each year to be represented and praised in our Local Notable Women Wall of Fame exhibit. Each exhibit is up for six months.

    "homepage_content":"Maritime Center – Lincoln County Historical Society The Pacific Maritime Heritage Center celebrates the history, art, diverse culture, commerce, and scientific research that is of the ocean. The Pacific Ocean fosters a diversity of fisheries that includes a far-reaching commercial fishing fleet, vital to this Oregon Coast community. The Pacific Maritime Heritage Center’s exhibits and programming are dedicated to telling the stories of those who share a desire to live and work where sea meets land, and along its rivers and estuaries. The Pacific Maritime Heritage Center is a major museum and interactive center that incorporates the working wharf, educational programs, and local maritime uses. The center features maritime-related exhibits and art. It has been designed to attract, educate, and entertain all ages, instilling in local residents and visitors a sense of place and community, a place they will want to visit again and again. Located in an impressive building on Newport’s historic Bayfront, the building and site were purchased by the Lincoln County Historical Society in 2004. The site was first graced with a home built in the 1880s for Dr. James Bayley and his wife, Elizabeth. That building burned in 1923, leaving only the foundation and chimney. A new home was built in 1925 by World War I hero General Ulysses Grant McAlexander on the site. In the late 1970s and early 80s, the structure underwent extensive remodeling and expansion and reopened as Smuggler’s Cove, a restaurant and nightclub. Up until 1999 it housed Gracie’s at Smuggler’s Cove, a popular restaurant. Want to see more? Watch some videos of the Maritime Center Off street parking is available for Maritime Museum visitors and event attendees. Simply go up the driveway marked with a sign that reads “Smuggler’s Cove.” Park anywhere except the five marked spaces that belong to Smuggler Cove condos. If you are attending an event at the Maritime Museum please carpool if you can. Learn more about some of the exhibits at the Maritime Center. Your donation will help keep the Maritime Center afloat.

Learn More About Us View Our Tours What We Do The National Wildlife Refuge System is a series of lands and waters owned and managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Wildlife conservation is at the heart of the Refuge System. It drives everything we do from the purpose a refuge is established, to the recreational activities offered there, to the resource management tools we use. Selecting the right tools helps us ensure the survival of local plants and animals and helps fulfill the purpose of Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. More About What We Do Our Species Malheur National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1908 to protect migratory waterfowl, with an emphasis on colonial nesting species. Today, the Refuge encompasses over 187,000 acres that are disproportionately important as a stop along the Pacific Flyway, and as a resting, breeding, and nesting area for hundreds of thousands of migratory birds and other wildlife. Many of the species migrating through or breeding at Malheur are highlighted as priority species in national bird conservation plans. View Our Species Get Involved Whether you want to further conservation, learn more about nature, or share your love of the outdoors, you’ve come to the right place. National wildlife refuges provide many opportunities for you to help your community by doing what you love. National wildlife refuges partner with volunteers, youth groups, landowners, neighbors, and residents of urban and coastal communities to make a lasting difference.

There will be changing demos and exhibits each week, so please come visit! Take a step back in time. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey transformed over the centuries from a relatively sparse Lenape Indian settlement in the 1600s to a primarily Dutch pioneer farming area with sandstone homes through the 1800s. By the early 1900s it also became a summer destination for city dwellers to escape the crowded streets of New York. The town went through a dramatic post-war development in the 1950s. Today, as a small suburban town dotted with historic homes, it retains the narrow winding roads, beautiful trees, and babbling brooks that attracted those early settlers of long ago. Join us as we journey through Upper Saddle River’s past.

    "homepage_content":"Museum Home About Officials Join By-Laws Historic Sites Museum Applications for National Historic Register Documentary Video Osborn-Cannonball House Title of Ownership Photos Contact Museum The small yellow clapboard house 1840 E. Front Street in Scotch Plains has been eyewitness to many events in its history since it was built in the early 1700’s. Both British and Continental troops marched past its front door during the Revolutionary War years; the Swift-Sure stage raced past on its way from New York to Philadelphia in the early 1800’s; generations of village children skipped its footpaths on their way to old School One; families name Osborn, Hetfield, Harper, Coles, Kelly and Snook called the little cottage “home; and since 1972 the old house has become our village museum. The careful construction of the house is typical of the early period-wooden pegs rather than iron nails, plaster made of crushed oyster shells strengthened with animal hair, low ceilings and doors, and brick filled walls. The original owners, Jonathan and Abagail Osborn, raised thirteen children in this snug home. Jonathan was an inn-keeper, farmer and tailor. His tavern was farther west on Front Street near Terrill Road. During this same period, the birth pangs of a mighty nation were also being experienced. Two of the Osborn sons helped the infant country survive by enlisting in the Army when the Revolutionary War broke out. John Baldwin the eldest, fought in the Revolution. Son number two, Jonathan Hand, was only 16 when he joined the troops as a drummer boy. The eldest son, John Baldwin, who “bearded the British Lion under Washington”, had left his home on Front Street to live in a larger home (at 2117 Westfield Avenue) when he married Mary Darby in 1774. While he served in the Army, his wife kept the home, cared for the children and became a heroine in her own right. In June, 1777, following the Battle of Short Hills fought near Ash Swamp in Scotch Plains, the American Army retreated before British General Sir Wlliam Howe and headed toward the safety of the Watchung Mountains. The Soldiers were “…in great destitution, some being without tents, blankets, shoes or provisions and under the utmost depression of sprits”. Young Mary Osborn, heart-sick at the plight of the men, immediately “…exerted herself with patriotic zeal to supply their wants, and gave for that purpose everything eatable or wearable that her house afforded”. Ironically, at approximately the same time Mary was helping our cause, a Colonial artilleryman fired his cannon in the direction of the oncoming British who were marching up Park Avenue. The shot was misdirected and thudded into the side of the Osborn house. From then on the townspeople referred to the house as the Cannonball House. Mary’s husband, John, lived his life as a farmer and acquired over 4000 acres of land. He later became a Deacon in the Scotch Plains Baptist Church and “sat under all the preachers for nearly a hundred years”. His brother, the drummer boy, later became a fine stone cutter whose work can still be seen on some of the head stones in “God’s Little Acre” next to the Baptist church in Scotch Plains. One of the younger brothers, David, Grew up to become the first clerk of the newly formed Westfield Township in 1794. He also was the first postmaster of Scotch Plains beginning in 1804. Today the old Osborn place has been carefully restored and furnished by the Historical Society of Scotch Plains and Fanwood. Visitors can readily see the original wide floor boards and hand hewn ceiling beams. The original kitchen has been uncovered complete with bee-hive oven and recessed porch. One of the old parlors is furnished with Victorian pieces and the other front room is decorated with Colonial furnishings. A Colonial flower and herb garden surrounds this little house, giving it the dignity and prestige its years deserve.

Learn More Donate LOCATION 2819 Andersonville Hwy. Clinton, TN 37716 FEATURED PHOTOS: Making Sorghum Molasses From the writings of Museum of Appalachia founder John Rice Irwin: Few activities in Appalachia were as quaint, colorful, festive, and necessary as molasses making. There were many steps in this process, and it required the help of all family members, men, women, and children. The grandparents and other kin, and often the neighbors, too, came to help. The cane had to be stripped of its fodder, and it had to be fed into the slowly revolving iron rollers. All day long the mule went round-and-round while the juice trickled out, ever so slowly. It had to be boiled and therein lay the secret to good molasses making. While it boiled, the green skim had to be skimmed off. The boiling had to be completely controlled one and an inexperienced person would ruin the results of a year’s labor. Molasses was not only used as a staple food throughout the year, but they were used as a sugar substitute, to make cakes, pies, cookies, etc. *Pictured is Vernon Snodderly running the cane mill at a Museum of Appalachia Fall Homecoming. Also pictured is Ed Disney (1914-2008) of the Dutch Valley community in Anderson County, TN. Disney, who learned molasses making at the age of 8, continued practicing the trade for the next 82 years. A demonstrator at the Museum of Appalachia for 18 years, Disney is photographed at the 1999 Homecoming boiling molasses (photo by Frank Hoffman).

And it honors the service of all brave volunteers who marched on the Natchez Trace during the War of 1812 to help establish American independence. The Natchez Trace served as an important route to move troops for the defense of the Gulf Coast Region. Tennessee volunteer calvary under leadership of Andrew Jackson marched down the Natchez Trace to Natchez in January 1813. General Jackson marched with his soldiers on their return April 1813. Solder detachments under Jackson's command again marched on the Natchez Trace in 1814. And following the victory of the Battle of New Orleans, most of the Americans who fought the battle returned on the Trace. Volunteers marched hundreds of miles often in severe weather with little food and inadequate equipment. Natchez Trace inns served as hospitals. Soldiers who did not survive the marches are buried in unmarked graves along the Trace. On General Jackson's return near this point, he proclaimed his view of the significance of the victory earned by the soldier's sacrifices \"Our Rights Will Henceforth Be Respected\". Tennessee State Society United States Daughters of 1812 On The Bicentennial June 16, 2012 Old Trace scroll down the page to view a Photo Gallery The U.S. Army cleared this section of the \"Natchez Road\" in 1801-02 and continued clearing southward with the consent of the Chickasaw Nation. This is the northernmost intersection of the old \"Natchez Road\" and the new \"Natchez Trace Parkway\". Heading north, the old path lies east of the modern parkway as it headed towards what is now downtown Nashville. The new roadway goes a little west towards the southwest corner of Nashville. This dirt path running along the ridge is a remnant of the original Natchez Trace. In the early 1800s it was the most direct route northward from the port of Natchez on the Mississippi to Nashville. In between were 500 miles of wilderness. Boatmen, mail riders, traders, soldiers, Indians and outlaws passed here. On horseback and on foot - later with wagons - they followed the serpentine trail into the deep woods of Indian country. By the mid-1800s cross country travelers turned to other means of transportation - steamboats, railroads and roads connecting developing towns. As the wilderness began to fade, so did the old wilderness road. Today only pieces of the Old Trace remain. This section of the Old Trace is also part of the Highland Rim Trail (Natchez Trace National Scenic Trail) . Hikers can park here and then hike on the trail either to the north or the south.

The Country Music Hall of Fame member has enjoyed seemingly effortless success as a singer, songwriter, movie and television actor, author, businesswoman, and philanthropist ever since she first hit the record charts in 1967. In truth, however, her achievements required determination to get past those who tried to limit the scale of her dreams. Learn More Muscle Shoals: Low Rhythm Rising The Museum’s latest exhibition, Muscle Shoals: Low Rhythm Rising , explores how an Alabama community developed a distinctive sound, became a global recording epicenter in the 1960s and 1970s, and continues to inspire music today. The exhibit tells the story of Black and white musicians who found a way to work together at a time when segregation prevailed. Producer Rick Hall and his FAME Recording Studio and the session aces at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio built a home-made approach to cutting music that mattered. As a result, hitmakers from R&B, rock, pop, and country music flocked to this quiet backwater to record, and a new rhythm arose. Exhibit supported by OneLouder.

Learn More Brooks & Dunn Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn—performing together as Brooks & Dunn—charged onto the country music scene in 1991. They went on to become the best-selling country duo of all time, with forty-one Top Ten hits (including twenty #1s) and two decades of packing concert arenas. They collected a mountain of music-industry honors, including two Grammys, nineteen CMA awards, and twenty-five ACM awards. Learn More Reba McEntire Reba McEntire ranks as the most successful female country performer of her generation, and she has been cited as a role model by nearly every successful woman to follow in her wake. She has achieved more than fifty Top Ten singles and more #1 country albums than any other female artist. McEntire has won CMA Female Vocalist of the Year four times and was CMA Entertainer of the Year in 1986. She also has won three Grammy Awards, and in 2018 received the prestigious Kennedy Center Honors for her lifetime of contributions to American culture. Learn More Hank Williams Hank Williams’s legend has long overtaken the rather frail and painfully introverted man who spawned it. Almost singlehandedly, Williams set the agenda for contemporary country songcraft, but his appeal rests as much in the myth that even now surrounds his short life.

    "homepage_content":"Rowe Historical Society 0 What would they think of us now…? …those old pioneers who struggled to tame this wilderness, and having done so, petitioned to incorporate into a town. — Nancy Newton Williams Mailman Will Upton in his buggy driving down Middletown Hill. The Rowe Historical Society was founded with the mission of preserving and sharing the local history with the residents and visitors to town. Rowe has a rich history of agriculture and industry with artifacts and imagery of the lives of its residents since before the revolutionary war. To awaken and maintain public interest in all matters relating to the history of the Town of Rowe. We understand that people see history in many different ways and we are continually looking at the ways we teach it, the ways we display it and the way we learn it. We have a museum that is accessible to every patron. Although our artifacts are not always touchable, each and every one has a story. Our goal is to make history come alive to all. Whether it’s through genealogical research, photographs, reference and print material, or through the tools and equipment from every decade, this is what we are trying to do at the Rowe Historical Society. Rowe Center ca. 1898 In the spring of 1762 Rev. Cornelius Jones bought a 10,000 acre parcel from the Massachusetts General Court and founded the Myrifield Plantation. He and his wife and 3 children under age 5 moved into a newly constructed house of split planks in the middle of the 15 square mile tract. He offered his lands at a low price, but new settlers were slow to come. By 1770 just eight families had settled in the Myrifield Plantation. At the outbreak of the revolution there were 28 families but only nine houses — the rest being log huts. But already there were two saw mills operated by water power and a goodly number of livestock. In 1784, with 88 pols (adult males), roads laid out and annual appropriations for gospel and schools, the people decided to incorporate as a town. About the Rowe Historical Society In 1957, inspried by the research and enthusiasm for Percy Brown’s book The History of Rowe , several townspeople formed the Rowe Historical Society. Their first meeting was held in November of that year and the Society was incorporated in July of the following year. Since that time RHS has received an abundance of Rowe related items such as an old town hearse in excellent condition, superb quilts, ladies’ fine dresses and accoutrements, many lovely old photos, farm implements and tools, mining items, Hoosac Tunnel memorabilia, musical instruments, children’s clothing and toys, and more. Our purpose is to honor our forebears and the items they have passed on to us. We lovingly care for and share them with visitors from Rowe and from far away. The Kemp-McCarthy Museum 282 Zoar Road Operating until 1962 , The Village School was then given to the Rowe Historical Society by the townspeople. It was the last one-room school in Franklin County. Having been added to several times, it now houses seven areas of collections and exhibits. The West School (b. 1797) on Tunnel Rd. was joined to the complex in 1996. There were nine schools in Rowe in the early 1900s. Browning Bench Tool Factory Pond Road This two and one half story barn was once a carriage and wagon shop and later a bench tool factory. It was moved to the town park property and restored as a part of Rowe’s participation in the nation’s bicentenial celebration in 1976. RHS has leased the building since 2017 to house farm and homemaking implements, bench tools, sleighs, sleds and historic photos. (learn more) Fort Pelham Pond Road In 1744 the Massachusetts General Court ordered the building of three forts to run from Fort Dummer in Brattleboro, VT, west to the NY border. They were Fort Shirley in Heath, Fort Pelham in Rowe and Fort Massachusetts in Williamstown. In 1961, the Society purchased the 24 acre Fort Pelham property on Ford Hill Rd. RHS has artifacts from excavations done at the site by UMass (1971–’72) and Yale University (1974). The village school ca. 1910 Rowe Historical Society Board of Trustees Wayne Zavotka, President Kerri McLatchy, Vice President Ellen Miller, Treasurer Susan Zavotka, Secretary Janet Cowie Kathy May Walt Quist Joanne Semanie Dana Williams Rowe Historical Society is a 100% volunteer organization.

Area Lodging and Information Visit Gainesville City of Gainesville About Dickinson Hall Dickinson Hall was named for Director Emeritus Dr. J. C. Dickinson, Jr. Its design reflects the pyramidal structures of Native Americans — Southeastern United States temple mounds from the front and Mesoamerican pyramids from the rear. The building is the signature piece of one of Florida’s most-renowned architects, William Morgan. The transfer of exhibits and public programs to the Powell Hall Education and Exhibition Center in 1998 generated additional space for teaching, scientific collections and research labs. The University of Florida Herbarium was relocated to Dickinson Hall and the remaining space has been retrofitted for research and collection expansion.",

Set on four beautiful acres of live oak trees, the museum includes 13 original structures built in Florida between 1870-1912. The buildings were relocated from around the state, restored and furnished to represent aspects of home life, transportation and commerce as it was in many rural communities just before the turn of the 20th century. The museum focuses on providing opportunities to learn about the daily lives of late 19th century Floridians, through hands-on school field trips, tours, special events and the annual Florida State Fair. Our programs incorporate historically dressed interpreters, folk life demonstrations and preservation of our historic resources. Top Left: Church, 1900 Bottom Left: Okahumpka Train Depot, 1898 Top Right: Portrait of Mildred W. & Doyle E. Carlton Jr. Bottom Right: Carlton House, 1885 A Museum is Born Cracker Country was founded in 1978 by Doyle Carlton, Jr and his wife, Mildred Woodbery Carlton on four acres of property inside the then-new Florida State Fairgrounds. This piece of land, with its moss covered live oak trees, seemed the perfect setting for their longtime vision: a living museum that would showcase and share with the community the history of rural Florida. The Carltons, both natives of Tampa, had deep roots in pioneer Florida. The Carlton and Woodbery families settled here in the early 19th century, when the territory of Florida was a sparsely populated wilderness. The museum debuted at the 1979 Florida State Fair with just two buildings: the 1885 Carlton House and the 1894 Smith House. Over the next decade, the Carltons continued to partner with the Florida State Fairgrounds and expanded the museum to include a one-room schoolhouse, general store, railroad depot, church, post office and more historic structures. The Carlton family continues to generously support Cracker Country today, helping the museum to educate new generations about the unique history of rural life in late 19th century Florida. shopping , community buildings , home buildings Cracker Country Living History Museum 6\/30\/23 shopping , community buildings , home buildings Cracker Country Living History Museum 6\/30\/23 General Store Read More community buildings Cracker Country Living History Museum 6\/30\/23 community buildings Cracker Country Living History Museum 6\/30\/23 Caboose Read More community buildings Cracker Country Living History Museum 6\/30\/23 community buildings Cracker Country Living History Museum 6\/30\/23 Terry Store Read More home buildings Cracker Country Living History Museum 6\/30\/23 home buildings Cracker Country Living History Museum 6\/30\/23 Smoke House Read More home buildings Cracker Country Living History Museum 6\/30\/23 home buildings Cracker Country Living History Museum 6\/30\/23 Smith House Read More community buildings Cracker Country Living History Museum 6\/30\/23 community buildings Cracker Country Living History Museum 6\/30\/23 School House Read More community buildings Cracker Country Living History Museum 6\/30\/23 community buildings Cracker Country Living History Museum 6\/30\/23 Rainey Store Read More community buildings Cracker Country Living History Museum 6\/30\/23 community buildings Cracker Country Living History Museum 6\/30\/23 Post Office Read More community buildings Cracker Country Living History Museum 6\/30\/23 community buildings Cracker Country Living History Museum 6\/30\/23 Okahumpka Train Depot Read More home buildings Cracker Country Living History Museum 6\/30\/23 home buildings Cracker Country Living History Museum 6\/30\/23 Murphy Kitchen Read More home buildings Cracker Country Living History Museum 6\/30\/23 home buildings Cracker Country Living History Museum 6\/30\/23 Kitchen Garden Read More community buildings Cracker Country Living History Museum 6\/30\/23 community buildings Cracker Country Living History Museum 6\/30\/23 Govenors Inn Read More home buildings Cracker Country Living History Museum 6\/30\/23 home buildings Cracker Country Living History Museum 6\/30\/23 Corn Crib Barn Read More community buildings Cracker Country Living History Museum 5\/17\/23 community buildings Cracker Country Living History Museum 5\/17\/23 Church The Church was built in the early 1900s in Gretna, FL.

The term “cracker” dates at least as far back as Shakespeare, who coined it in the play King John. From the early 19th century it was used to describe the hardy, self-reliant and often poor pioneers who migrated from the north in search of a better life in the harsh Florida wilderness. Later, the term became associated with Florida’s rugged cattlemen. Cattle, descended from stock left behind by the Spanish, roamed freely in the Florida woodlands. Cow hunters used whips to flush the cattle from the underbrush and drive them to ports for shipment north or to Cuba. Whips were not used to strike the cattle. They were popped in the air to make a “crack” sound to get the cattle moving. The sound traveled great distances, making the whip an essential communication tool between cowmen. A commonly used 120 mile cattle drive route across the south central part of the state is known today as the Florida Cracker Trail.",

This dramatic saga of courage and perseverance has inspired generations as an iconic immigration experience and was the reason our organization was established in 1820. As the nationâs oldest continuously operating public museum, we embrace a commitment to telling this story with historical accuracy, inclusion, and renewed recognition for histories that traditionally have been submerged, silenced, or erased. Pilgrim Hall Museum houses an unmatched collection of Pilgrim possessions, revealing the stories of ordinary yet determined men and women building new lives and homes for their families in a new world. On display are William Bradfordâs Bible, the only portrait of a Pilgrim (Edward Winslow) painted from life, the cradle brought by expectant mother Susanna White on the Mayflower, the great chair of the colonyâs spiritual leader William Brewster, and the earliest sampler made in America, embroidered by Myles Standishâs daughter, Loara. At Pilgrim Hall Museum, our core focus encompasses the presence and experiences of the Wampanoag, \"People of the Dawn,\" the Indigenous People who inhabited this area for over 13,000 years before the arrival of the English colonists and who are still here today. Exhibitions and programs trace the story of the interrelationship between the Wampanoag and the early colonial settlers from first encounters through the disastrous conflict of the 1670s, known as King Philip's War. For 200 years, our organization has fostered knowledge and new understandings of Plymouth Colony’s beginnings - and never more so than today, during the extraordinary challenges of our own times. We invite you to explore this history with us, and uncover a storehouse of resources on four centuries of Plymouthâs past. Online Store Open â your purchase helps support Pilgrim Hall! Pilgrim Hall Museum in Plymouth, MA, announces a major capital project to replace a failing roof and skylight directly over its original 1824 gallery full of iconic New England artworks and artifacts. Our museum is one of the nationâs oldest public museums, built in 1824 by the Pilgrim Society (established 1820). After rain was discovered falling inside the original 200-year-old gallery, a temporary rubber roof was installed to prevent immediate damage to irreplaceable collections. In late June 2023, the Pilgrim Society Board of Trustees endorsed a $6.4 million campaign to replace the roof and skylight, install new museum quality lighting, upgrade HVAC systems, and steward historical materials during the extensive construction required ahead. The project includes the restoration of monumental artwork and innovative exhibit redesign for a transformative impact on the visitor experience. Right now in the summer of 2024 , our urgent need is for funds to remove and conserve the massive, irreplacable artwork which has lived on the walls of the Main Gallery since the 19th century. Please help us with this phase of the project! All donations for conservation received this year will help us meet a significant matching grant, and we thank you! It's on! As of early August, work has begun. Follow our progress here on Facebook!

Pilgrim Hall Museum and the Plymouth Antiquarian Society recorded a free virtual program on Thursday, March 24, 2022 at 6:30 pm. âFact & Myth: Dorothy May Bradford Rememberedâ features presentations by two scholars who explore the impact of literature and film on our understanding of 17th-century womenâs history. Dr. Kari Miller, Professor of English at Georgia State Universityâs Perimeter College in Atlanta, discusses the influential Pilgrim fiction of American author Jane Goodwin Austin (1831-1894). Dr. Miller focuses on the story âWilliam Bradfordâs Love Lifeâ to explore the ways Austin used fact, fiction, and speculation in her work and how that impacted not only her legacy, but also American culture. Dr. Stacey Dearing, Teaching Assistant Professor of English at Siena College in Loudonville, NY, discusses how Dorothy May Bradfordâs death in December 1620 has been represented in pop culture. Using National Geographicâs 2015 miniseries Saints & Strangers as a case study, Dr. Dearing argues for the importance of telling Bradfordâs story â and those of all the women of the Mayflower â while also clearly demarcating facts from myths.

More Information... As we continue to carry out our mission by preserving stories, photos and documents from the community, our view on the past becomes clearer. Sometimes connections are made or a new perspective is gained when we discover an unknown piece of information. Each historical tidbit we capture sharpens our focus and the historic picture becomes easier to see. More Images... About The Roseville Historical Society In the early 1980s the old Carnegie Library building was potentially slated for a very different purpose and there was rumored discussion that the land the building stood upon was to be turned into a parking lot. But then, something extraordinary happened. During a meeting where the building’s fate was to be decided, a relative of the pioneer McRae family spoke to the group. It seemed, she said, that since the city was no longer going to use the land that her family donated for library purposes, that she would be expecting to take her land back. The McRae family had indeed donated the land with a caveat; the land, with the Carnegie Library built upon it, was to be used as a library in perpetuity. The original deed was verified and the old building was saved. But it needed restoration and a purpose. The good citizens of Roseville banded together and formed “The Roseville Historical Society” with the purpose of preserving and protecting the history of Roseville. Together with the city, funds were raised for restoration and the venerable old building was once again a library but with the new focus of educating people about the history of Roseville. In effect, it became the “Carnegie Library Museum.” In 2012, the Roseville Historical Society celebrated the venerable 100-year-old building that houses the history of a wonderful city. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places and it is a modern day testament to what can be accomplished when we come together to ensure our history is preserved. About This Website Following the mission of the Roseville Historical Society, our primary goal with this website is to preserve and promote the history of our city. Secondarily, we aim for those efforts to educate and inspire our community. Production of these pages is the result of combined efforts of many people, some who actively participated over the past few months and others whose photographs, text or other works were produced years, or even more than a century ago. Roseville historians deserve the most credit for their contributions of researching, recording, interpreting and preserving our collective history. Most notably, Leonard \"Duke\" Davis, whose many books lay a solid foundation for describing the people, places and events from which Roseville was built. The recent contributions of our historian, Phoebe Astill maintain the same passion and integrity for preserving our history. Ms. Astill is a life-long resident of Roseville, descended from a pioneer family and is a past curator of the Carnegie Museum. Content for this site was pulled from the archives of the Roseville Historical Society, published works of Leonard \"Duke\" Davis, materials supplied by the Maidu Museum and Historic Site, public domain images, and recent color photographs by Greg Dowden. The information was collected by members of the Roseville Historical Society, both past and present. The guiding principle of our effort is accurate reporting of historical facts. However, errors sometimes occur and we encourage the community to notify us immediately if any errors are noted. We appreciate interaction with the community and capturing the stories of our past that make us who we are. Remembering Leonard \"Duke\" Davis We honor and give many thanks to Co-Founder of the Roseville Historical Society in 1983, Leonard \"Duke\" Davis whose research on Roseville provided invaluable contributions to our community. Mr. Davis passed away on October 10th, 2014. At his request, no funeral services were held - and in true Duke Davis form he requested donations be made in his name to the Roseville Historical Society instead. The obituary published in the Auburn Journal is available to read online. © 2024 Roseville Historical Society. All Rights Reserved.",

    "homepage_content":"Walk Through History - Big Horn County Historical Museum Connect with us Walk Through History Our history is so much more than dusty relics on a shelf. History itself is a story. A story filled with emotion, lessons, and often the haunting reminders of what has been. The Big Horn County Historical Museum opened in 1979 on a 22-acre vegetable farm located 44 miles east of Billings off I-90 (exit 497), just outside of Hardin, and only 15 miles from the famous Little Big Horn Battlefield. In 2012 the museum grounds expanded to 35 acres and is currently the beautiful home to 24 historic structures that have been rescued from destruction and meticulously preserved. Each building is brimming with exhibits that represent bygone eras and will give you not just a glimpse, but a full view of life before our time. Walk through the historic LaForge Cabin, barn, and blacksmith shop and smell the hand-cut logs neatly chinked into place. Experience a true Crow tepee which the Crow referred to as “second mother.” They believed, “a tepee is your second mother. Your first mother is the Earth, upon which the tepee rests.” Or take a seat in a 1915 Doctor’s office and imagine the number of people that received life-saving care in its 72 years of service. Each building is brought to life through the collection of photographs and artifacts lovingly housed inside. Alongside these culture-rich buildings are exhibits constructed to house horse-drawn equipment, an extensive collection of tractors, farm equipment, and classic automobiles. Inside our beautiful new facility, our gallery exhibits share the history of Fort Custer on the Big Horn, constructed during the Indian Wars and named for General George Armstrong Custer who died at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. The rich culture of the Plains Indians is colorfully represented along with artifacts from missionaries on the reservations. Famous cowboy writer Will James, whose namesake graces many monuments including a Middle School in the area, brings the American West to life with not only exhibits inside the museum but his studio, cabins, and a native plant area which call our grounds home. No matter the history that tickles your fancy, be it Cowboys or Plains Indians, The Big Horn County Historical Museum and Visitors Center will not disappoint. The museum has become a strong focal point in the community for gathering and educational experiences and is available for special programs, educational and private tours, as well as special events such as family reunions and weddings. We continue to develop and add priceless artifacts and learning opportunities to our grounds. Our guests will see our continued restoration and preservation efforts as they tour the boardwalk and museum grounds. This continued development is a testimony to the commitment and the strength of the partnership of private and public efforts to preserve the heritage of our area. No matter whether you roam our gallery, gift shop, research library, archives, visitor center, or offices, you will encounter a staff member or local resident that is passionate about sharing the gifts history has to offer.

Four sites - the History Museum of Mobile, Clotilda : The Exhibition at the Africatown Heritage House, Colonial Fort Condé, and the Phoenix Fire Museum - bring Mobile’s past to life for tens of thousands of visitors each year. Start your visit at the History Museum of Mobile, where over 20,000 square feet of exhibit space interpret Mobile’s history from pre-Colonial contact to the modern Port City. Don’t miss the children’s discovery room, where families can explore a French ship, play real African drums, try on colonial clothing, practice basket weaving, and more! Special exhibitions are always changing, so be sure to check the schedule . Your admission also covers Colonial Fort Condé, a partial reconstruction of the 1723 fort built when the French founded Mobile. And don’t miss the Phoenix Fire Museum, where horse-drawn steam engines and antique ladder trucks bring to life Mobile’s proud history of volunteer firefighting. In March of 2020, the History Museum of Mobile announced a partnership with the Mobile County Commission, the City of Mobile, the Alabama Historical Commission, and community leaders in Africatown to create a landmark exhibition at the under-construction Africatown Heritage House. Clotilda: The Exhibition tells the story of the people aboard the last slave ship to the United States. The pieces of the Clotilda that have been recovered from the shipwreck are on display in the exhibition, on loan from the Alabama Historical Commission. The exhibition was curated, developed, and designed in conjunction with the local community and the wider descendent community, and in consultation with experts around the country. History Museum of Mobile operates Africatown Heritage House as a fourth museum site. The History Museum of Mobile is the eight-time recipient of the “Best Museum” Nappie, Mobile Bay’s people’s choice award. In 2021, the museum received two awards for innovative programming: the Main Street Mobile’s Chairman’s Certificate and Visit Mobile’s MOBie.",

At that time, it was one of the few Victorian ranch houses in the county. As their oldest son, Juan “John” Galindo and his bride Marina “Sarah” (Amador) Galindo took up residence between 1875 and 1880, the original six-room house was expanded to ten rooms. After Juan and Marina’s eldest child Frederick, and Catherine (Hittman) Galindo were married in 1907, title was transferred to this next generation.
