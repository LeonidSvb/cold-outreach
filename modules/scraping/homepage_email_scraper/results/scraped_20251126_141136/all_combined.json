The full name of this museum is the \"Greatest Generation\" World War Two Museum. It was founded by a couple originally from Belgium whose parents had experienced the ravages of WWII. They amassed an impressive collection of uniforms, arms and personal items for display in the museum. One particular item was a rifle with one of the earliest night vision scopes. The uniforms are worn by mannequins with each mannequin having a unique face, head and hands created by the owner. The mannequins are very realistic! K.C. Annapolis, MD Preston County Sports Museum Before consolidation of schools in 1986, there were ten high schools in Preston County, each with its own sports program. They were Aurora, Arthurdale, Bruceton Mills, Fellowsville, Kingwood, Masontown, Newburg, Rowlesburg, Terra Alta, and Tunnelton. There was always vigorous but friendly competition among the schools for the county title. Preston County Sports Collection In 2012 a group of representatives from the ten schools organized a project to create a museum in the Historic Rowlesburg School Szilagyi Center dedicated to the golden years of county sports, including, football, basketball, and baseball.

Your contributions will be archived with those of other Newtowners and accessed in the future by scholars, townspeople, students and others who study and look back on this historic time in our modern life. We were all touched by COVID-19 in very different and personal ways. Children and parents, seniors and students, merchants, highly educated professionals...all creatively finding new ways to work and play safely. Every kind of individual and family has been forced to adopt new habits almost overnight. Much of the story of COVID-19 will be about hardship and difficulty, but not all. A complete record should reflect new work requirements and adaptations, pastimes, family time, entertainment, steps to protect from the virus, changes in the household and other personal observations describing how our lives have been affected by the pandemic. Please join us in updating our archive that chronicled our shared experience with COVID-19 five years later.

An informal group of history buffs met prior to 1975 with Bishop von Wettberg as their president, but it wasn’t until 1975 that the present group was legally incorporated. Jane Fertig was the first president. Inspired by the National Bicentennial of 1976, the OHS formed a committee of volunteers to research and write Early Houses of Oxford . It was published in hardcover in time for the Bicentennial and has since been reprinted in paperback format. In 2016 under the direction of Marilyn Stebar, that book was updated and expanded with the publication Historic Buildings of Oxford, Past and Present . The Society continued to meet, sponsoring programs on local history and on crafts such as quilts and stenciling. There were social events as well including wildly popular progressive dinners during the holidays and trips to historic sites such as Wethersfield and Sleepy Hollow. Members also continued to preserve Oxford’s past, maintaining a file in the Town Clerk’s vault and taping interviews with long-time Oxford residents. In 2004 all that changed. The 1752 Twitchell-Rowland Homestead on Christian Street was about to be demolished to make way for a new housing development. First under the direction of President Sue Kopec and later Town Historian Dorothy DeBisschop, the Historical Society raised funds to move the house in 2006 to its present location at 60 Towner Lane on property donated by Fred and Myrtle Rowland. Four years of work by over 300 volunteers culminated in 2010 when the building opened at last as the Oxford’s first museum. In 2016, the Munn Schoolhouse was also moved to the site and restored, first directed by Mrs. De Bisschop and later by Bo Duncan. That structure too became available to the public for tours in 2025. The Oxford Historical Society continues to work to save and to generate interest in our town’s history. The museum and schoolhouse are open on the first and third Sundays of each month for tours and a collection of historic artifacts and documents is maintained. The summer of 2025 launched craft programs in the schoolhouse: “Fun at the Munn,” taught by Bo Duncan. The very popular Fiber Festival, Peach Festival and Tractor Show at the Homestead plus the annual meeting in November featuring a speaker on state or local history all serve to educate and entertain the public about our past. We’ve come a long way! Our Town’s History is Our Country’s History Letters from relatives, a grandmother’s diary, photos and videos, and other material collected over the years provide vital and unique information about a life or the history of a family. These can be important to individuals. But they may also be important to our Oxford. Whether or not members of a local family attained a degree of fame, they have contributed to the heritage of a certain place and time. The Oxford Historical Society collects archives of Oxford residents and organizations. The Society may agree to receive the actual documents and photos or the Society may borrow them to be copied and returned to the owners. When you donate or loan personal, family or organization papers to the Oxford Historical Society, they become a part of Oxford’s – and America’s – collective memory. Persons with old photos or documents relating to the people of Oxford, are invited to call Historical Society historian Nancy Farnum (203-888-0230) to arrange a review of the material and determine how to preserve them for future generations.

Read More... × General Nathanael Greene (1742-1786) Nathanael Greene was born at the Forge Grist Mill in Potowomut, Warwick R.I., July 27, 1742, to Nathanael a preacher in the Society of Friends and Mary (Mott) Greene. Nathanael Jr. and his brothers were trained by their father as ironmasters. The family business at the forge prospered and this led to the establishment of a second ironworks in Coventry, ten miles from the Potowomut forge on the south branch of the Pawtuxet River. This business grew and by 1768 over 100 families lived in the vicinity of their Coventry forge. Nathanael made his home at the Coventry forge in 1770 and ran the family business. A setback occurred in 1772 when a fire destroyed the Coventry forge. Although efforts to rebuild were slow, the forge was eventually rebuilt. Today there is no evidence of a forge. An avid reader since boyhood, Nathanael actually had no formal education. Nathanael believed that a war was inevitable between the colonists and the mother country, Britain. Because of this concern, he joined in the establishment of the Kentish Guards of East Greenwich. This military unit, organized by charter of the Rhode Island General Assembly, was trained by a British sergeant, a deserter, who Nathanael had persuaded to join the colonists' cause. On the evening of April 19, 1775, news of the British attack at Lexington reached Nathanael. Realizing the gravity of the situation, Greene mounted his horse and rode to East Greenwich where he joined other members of the Kentish Guard and marched onward to Boston. Soon after, the Rhode Island general Assembly appointed Greene, General of the Army of Observation. With a portion of this force, he joined the American troops besieging Boston. Six weeks later, Congress appointed Greene Brigadier General of the Continental Army. Later, he was named Major General. As Quartermaster General and war strategist, Greene was involved in the major battles of the Revolution including Harlem Heights, Trenton, Brandywine, Valley Forge and Portsmouth Rhode Island. Following the defeat of Generals Lincoln and Gates in the south, Washington appointed General Greene to command the southern forces. Under this command came success at Eutaw Springs and Guilford Court House and the withdrawal of Lord Cornwallis to Virginia. As the war ended, General Greene and others received gifts of land tracts and Tory plantations from South Carolina and Georgia in appreciation for the defeat of Cornwallis. Among the holdings given Greene was Mulberry Grove, a plantation on the Savannah River in Georgia. (pictured here) After the war ended, the Greenes faced with enormous debts incurred during the war from the letter of credit Nathanael had received to provide money for provisions for his troops. An agent sent to purchase the provisions absconded with the funds. The provisions had to be provided, so Greene pledged repayment expecting Congress to compensate him. The creditors' demands for reimbursements obliged the General to sell some properties. Congress did vote the funds but it was not until 1792 several years after Greene's death, that the matter was finally resolved. In 1783, General Greene's family moved from Coventry to Newport for a brief time and then to Mulberry Grove. The Homestead in Coventry was signed over to his brother Jacob. In 1786, General Greene died of sunstroke while riding through his plantation. He was buried in the colonial cemetery of Christ Episcopal Church in the Graham vault in Savannah, Georgia. Later his remains were removed from the cemetery and re-interred in Johnson Square, Savannah Georgia. Close Katherine Littlefield Greene Katharine or sometimes Catherine with a nickname of Caty was born Katharine Littlefield, the 3rd child and first daughter of John and Phoebe (Ray) Littlefield on the Island of New Shoreham now known as Block Island on December 17, 1753. Read More... × Katharine (Littlefield) Greene (1754-1814) Katharine or sometimes Catherine with a nickname of Caty was born Katharine Littlefield, the 3rd child and first daughter of John and Phoebe (Ray) Littlefield on the Island of New Shoreham now known as Block Island on December 17, 1753. Little is known of her childhood but it is presumed she attended the town school and the Baptist meetinghouse. When her mother passed away, she came to live with her aunt Catherine (Ray) and uncle William who became the Governor of Rhode Island and was a third cousin of Nathanael. Under her aunt's guidance, Caty (or Kitty) learned all the social graces of her day. She was a delightful and animated woman who came to demand respect of the great men of her day by her courage and charm. In July, 1774 when she married Nathanael in her uncle's mansion on Division Street in Warwick, she was 19 and he was 32. The wedding was officiated by the Baptist minister, Elder John Gorton. Two years later in 1776, there began a succession of five children born to the Greenes. Their names were George Washington (1776), Martha Washington (1777), Cornelia Lott (1778) pictured below in a real photo taken ca. 1854, Nathanael Ray (1780) and Louisa Catharine (1784). The first winter of the Revolution when smallpox raged in Boston, Caty opened the Coventry Homestead as a hospital for soldiers recovering from the illness but four men died at the Homestead. Officers wives often visited the encampments during the winter. While staying with Nathanael the winter of 1775, Caty met the Washingtons and they became lifelong friends. Caty's witty and vivacious personality made her a popular hostess. Her ability to learn and speak French endeared her to General Lafayette. She continued to serve her countrymen by following the troops to many major battles. She was well known for her hospitality throughout the eight long years of war. After the war they moved to their southern plantation known as Mulberry Grove. Upon the death of Nathanael in 1786, Caty was left at age 30 with five small children. In 1790 she married for a second time to Phineas Miller who had been a tutor for the Greene children. On a return from a visit to New York, she met a man named Eli Whitney. Caty became aware of Eli's ingenuity and persuaded him to turn his talents to devising a machine that could separate the seeds from the raw cotton. In 1793 he invented the \"cotton gin\" which was the machine that could do this job. Whitney had financial troubles and Caty came to help him by pledging her entire financial resources. By 1800, she was forced to sell Mulberry Grove and the family relocated to a mansion known as \"Dungeness\" on Cumberland Island off the coast of Georgia purchased by Nathanael as a gift to Caty before his death. Caty lived as Dungeness until her death on September 2, 1814 ad age 59 years. She was buried there on her estate. Close History of the Homestead Built by Nathanael in 1770, the \"Homestead\" as it historically has been known, was originally called \"Spell Hall\" as it was indicated in one of Nathanael's letters. Read More... × History of the Homestead Built by Nathanael in 1770, the \"Homestead\" as it historically has been known, was originally called \"Spell Hall\" as it was indicated in one of Nathanael's letters. Constructed on the hillside, the site chosen for the Homestead was well sheltered on the west by natural woods. The land to the front sloped eastward as a terrace to the Pawtuxet River. Originally the house overlooked a broad area of open woodland meadow. The building is a well preserved 18th century structure of simple, yet refined design. Originally the site had 83 acres but at the time of the 1919 sale to the Homestead Association, it had been reduced to 13 acres of open space and woodlands. The 2 & 1\/2 story structure is typical of it's time in design. Around the 1870's, the front door area was Victorianized with a bracketed hood and double window door. During the early 1920's, an 18th century door with appropriate trim was attached to the opening making it look as it would have in Nathanael's time. During the 1870's a fire started that burned up to the second floor in the vicinity of the door. The two main floors of the home each consist of four rooms on either side of a central hall. The rooms on the first floor are dining room, parlor, library and kitchen - each having a paneled fireplace. The completely intact interior was first restored in the early 1920's with the establishment of the building as a museum. A second major restoration was accomplished in 1990 showing from then on a more correct perspective of the house when the Quaker family lived there. An extensive paint analysis was accomplished in the 1990 restoration giving now the earliest colors used throughout the 18th century home. The rooms on the second floor are what we feel they would have been there in the 18th and 19th centuries. The first bedroom on the right as you ascend the stairs might have been used by Nathanael and later his brother Jacob. The room diagonally across the hall might have been used by Jacob Varnum Greene, the son of Jacob and the bedroom on the right is decored Victorian style with wallpaper and lace curtains since the occupant, Elizabeth Margaret who was the daughter of Jacob Varnum, lived until 1899, the Victorian era. The fourth room is used now as a museum shop. When Nathanael and Caty moved from Coventry, the house was purchased by Nathanael's brother Jacob. He and his wife Peggy continued to live there until they died and the same was true of the next two generations. Upon the death of Elizabeth Margaret, the property was inherited by the children of her first marriage, Patience and Harris Inman. In 1915 the home was sold out of the family. Showing great concern for the property, four members of the Kent County Chapter of the Rhode Island Sons of the American Revolution purchased the property in 1919, restored it and gave it the name we know today as the Nathanael Greene Homestead. the first caretaker, actually lived in the house but by 1935, a caretaker's cottage was built and is used to this day.

The first internment was Miss Margaret Greene in 1786. She was the daughter of Jacob (brother of General Nathanael Greene) and Margaret Greene. Along with the 17 identified internments, there are four field stone graves identified from an 1859 Providence Journal article (Providence Journal, 1859 #27) as Revolutionary War soldiers who were being nursed for smallpox at the homestead. They died at the homestead. This photo and the previous one were taken in 1914 by Ethel Nichols, a young girl who lived in the village of Anthony.

The Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Arch The Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Arch was designed by Hartford architect George Keller, whose ashes were buried in the east tower when he died in 1935, along with those of his wife, Mary, who died in 1946. The arch was dedicated on September 17, 1886, –the anniversary of the Battle of Antietam–to honor the 4,000 Hartford citizens who served in the Civil War, and the 400 who died for the Union. Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Arch in Hartford This Gothic monument is made of brownstone from Portland, Connecticut, and cost about $60,000 (from the city treasury) to build. Notice especially the terra cotta frieze depicting scenes from the Civil War, and midway below it, eight-foot-tall statues representing the various kinds of residents who left their homes, families and businesses to fight in the War: student, farmer, freed slave, stone mason, carpenter and blacksmith. The original terra cotta angels–Gabriel and Raphael–which crown each tower, were replicated in bronze and replaced in 1987 as part of a $1.5 million restoration. Be sure to read the bronze plaque under the freed slave which honors the 128 African American residents of Hartford who fought for the Union. This plaque was added after research by Airron Bethea, a seventh-grade student in Hartford, who wrote an essay in 1987 for the rededication of the restored Arch.

Samuel Dexter Denison (1810-1880). The flag only had 34 stars for two years between the addition of Kansas in 1861 and West Virginia in 1863. Those were important years for the flag which previously had been mostly seen on ships and army bases; it was allowed to be carried into battle for the first time. When Union patriotism made it a popular purchase, it was mass manufactured for the first time. This one was definitely not mass produced; the top stripe is made of several pieces as though the maker ran short of fabric. Her arrangement of stars may seem random but until 1912 U.S. law didn’t require any particular pattern. Explore, Enjoy, Shop! View fullsize Explore nature! View fullsize Enjoy the gardens!

    "homepage_content":"Rich Mountain Battlefield : Beverly Heritage Tourism First step into statehood The Rich Mountain Battlefield is the site of the July 11, 1861 battle that gave the Union a foothold and control of western Virginia for the bulk of the Civil War. This was the first step in the separation of Virginia along Union and Confederate lines, eventually leading to the creation of West Virginia as a Northern state in 1863. The Battle of Rich Mountain Rich Mountain Battlefield consists of over 440 acres including the following sites: The Hart Farm Located at the top of Rich Mountain, the homestead of the Hart family was where the bulk of the fighting occurred. The Hart Farm site includes historical markers and many interpretive signs that tell the story of the Battle. Other highlights include a half-mile walking trail, Lander’s rock, the remains of the Hart family’s spring house, and graffiti carved by soldiers. Camp Garnett Located 1.5 miles West of the main Battlefield was the site of the Confederate camp. Here you can see the remains of defensive earthworks. The Field of Fire This park and pavilion just west of Camp Garnett is available by reservation for special events. Includes a hiking trail that connects to Camp Garnett. DIRECTIONS: To reach Rich Mountain Battlefield from the East: (Beverly) Turn off Rt 250 west onto Rich Mountain Road in Beverly. Follow the RMBF signs 5 miles to the Battlefield, at the very top of the mountain pass. Continue following Rich Mountain Road another 1 1\/2 miles further west to the bottom of the mountain to see the Camp Garnett area. To reach the site from the West (US48\/US33): At the Norton Exit off US48\/US33 (1.4 miles east of the stoplight intersection with Rt 250) turn right onto Rt 151. When Rt 151 comes to a T-intersection, turn right and cross the bridge and follow RMBF signs. Just across the bridge, turn left to Norton. Continue 4 miles, then turn left toward Mabie. Continue an additional 2 miles, then bear left onto Rich Mountain Road. Continue about 1.5 miles to Field of Fire Park and Camp Garnett. The battlefield lies another 1.5 miles further, at the peak of the road pass. Please notice: As you enjoy your visit to Rich Mountain Battlefield, please help us to protect the site. Observe all posted rules, including those against digging, artifact hunting, or metal detectors. The site contains rough ground that cannot be made perfectly safe without destroying its historic character. Please exercise caution in moving about on the mountain!

Thank you! Owned by the City of Glen Dale and operated through a partnership with the Marshall County Historical Society, the Historic Cockayne Farmstead is a unique historic site unlike any other in Marshall County, West Virginia. The 1850 farmhouse has been described as \"frozen in time,\" with the last major renovation occurring around the turn of the 20th century. The exterior of the house has been restored, but the interior has been preserved in place. The collection inside the house, consisting of only original items amassed by four generations of the Cockayne family, spans the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries ending with the death of the last owner in 2001, and includes over 3000 objects and over 15,000 documents. Guided tours of this amazing property are offered Monday-Friday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tour is approximately 1 hour. Walk-in tours are more than welcome, although advance notice is appreciated for any groups and required for groups over 10 people. Each of the four generations of the Cockayne family left its mark on the house and farm. Bennett Benjamin built his family’s new home in 1850 and took an active role in establishing the community of Elizabethtown, serving as its postmaster and one of the original twelve trustees tasked with laying out its streets and sidewalks. Samuel Andrew Jackson took his father’s farm and brought it international recognition through his expert cultivation of Merino sheep and a premium award for wool from the International Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876. Samuel Alexander “Zan” continued the farm’s influence in the wool industry by marketing wool between local farmers and eastern markets, serving as a county wool dealer during the First World War. And finally the second Samuel Andrew Jackson, often simply known as Sam, left a continuing legacy to Marshall County by deciding to leave his farm the way it was, even as everything changed around him. Also visit the Marshall County Historical Society website to learn about our other projects! Our Mission To create an educational and cultural center from a unique historic property that will nurture individual creativity and artistic expression, encourage the development of leadership skills and community pride through the rich cultural heritage of West Virginia, and promote tourism and economic development for the betterment of the citizens of our state and our nation.

House Tour A stalwart survivor of once the most elite Hartford neighborhood, the Isham-Terry House was a family residence and medical office in a city being rapidly reshaped by expanding industries, shifting gender roles, and newly arriving immigrant groups. In 1896, Dr. Oliver Isham purchased the 1854 Italianate house for himself, his parents, and his three sisters. His sisters, Julia and Charlotte, lived in the house until their deaths in the 1970s as urban renewal reshaped Hartford. Upcoming Tours Programs & Events A Mid-Century Holiday with the Ishams December 13 @ 1:00 pm – 4:00 pm Music from A Charlie Brown Christmas December 14 @ 1:45 pm – 3:00 pm LEARN MORE Built in 1854 by Ebenezer Roberts, the house was purchased by Dr. Oliver Isham in 1896. A descendant of the locally prominent Isham and Terry families, he operated his doctor’s office out of the house while living there with his parents and three sisters. In the mid-20 th century, as most of the houses in the neighborhood were torn down to make way for the highway, Julia and Charlotte Isham remained in the house and resisted the encroachment of I-84. Today, the house is prominently visible from I-84 East, which passes within a few dozen feet of the structure. The footprint of the house remains the same as it was when it was built in 1854, with the three-story rectangular tower added in 1883. The 15-room mansion is adorned with crown moldings, ceiling medallions, Lincrusta wall coverings, hand-painted walls and ceilings, gilt mirrors and valances, stained glass windows, elaborate gas-light chandeliers and many original kitchen and bathroom appliances and fixtures. It is filled with objects of historical, artistic and family significance including antique furnishings, decorative arts, rare books, the Terry clocks made famous by the last residents’ great great uncle Eli Terry, early Connecticut auto ephemera, and memorabilia from Hartford Public High School, the Ishams’ beloved alma mater. Dr. Isham’s medical office, with surgical instruments and medicines, has been left largely undisturbed since the 1940s. Page load link Go to Top",

Make a Donation Museum Education Research & Collections Events & Workshops A Brief History Of Our Museum First and foremost, The Institute for American Indian Studies (IAIS) seeks to provide resources for the preservation and resurgence of Indigenous knowledge and lifeways. Today, the IAIS museum provides Indigenous-led education that centers Indigenous perspectives for thousands of non-Indigenous museum visitors and K-12 students every year. For the past several years, our knowledgeable Education Department has been restructured by Darlene Kascak, Schaghticoke Tribal Nation (STN). During this time, IAIS has become a critical site of learning decolonial histories for non-Indigenous Americans, as well as a site of research and cultural revitalization (through Indigenous-led workshops) for Indigenous peoples. The Institute for American Indian Studies (IAIS) began in 1975 as a collaborative research hub between Indigenous (see our Hall of Elders) and non-Indigenous archaeologists and community members in western Connecticut formerly called the American Indian Archaeological Institute (AIAI). Since 1975, IAIS has surveyed or excavated over 500 sites, including the remarkable discovery of a 11,000-year-old camp site, the Templeton Site—one of the earliest known archaeological sites in Connecticut. Excavations are done in consultations with local tribal groups. Within its Research and Collections Department, the IAIS manages over 6,000 ethnographic (post-European contact) items and over 300,000 archaeological artifacts that represent hundreds of Native American societies throughout the western Hemisphere that range in age from over 12,000 years before present to the 21st century. Many of these ethnographic materials were collected by non-Indigenous settlers under unethical circumstances, and as a result, IAIS museum strives to return cultural artifacts to their descendent communities wherever possible.

Reviews “On behalf of Tiverton High School and all the students who had the incredible opportunity to visit the World War II Museum, I want to extend our deepest gratitude for hosting us. Our visit was nothing short of enlightening and inspiring. Stepping into the museum felt like journeying back in time, immersing us in the sights, sounds, and stories of one of the most pivotal periods in human history. The meticulous curation of artifacts, the immersive exhibits, and the passionate guides truly brought the era to life, making history more than just a subject but an experience to be felt and understood.For many of our students, this visit was their first encounter with the sacrifices, struggles, and triumphs of those who lived through World War II. It sparked curiosity, empathy, and a deeper appreciation for the freedoms we enjoy today. We are immensely grateful for the warm welcome, the insightful tours, and the unforgettable experience you provided us with. The memories and lessons from our visit will stay with us for a lifetime, shaping us into more informed and empathetic citizens. Your dedication to preserving and sharing this important chapter of history is commendable. Thank you again for your hospitality, your passion, and your commitment to preserving the legacy of World War II. We look forward to future opportunities to collaborate and continue our exploration of history together.” With heartfelt appreciation, Andrew Gacioch and David Landoch-Educators, Tiverton High School Gwyneth – Tiverton High School Student “At the end of January, my school went on a field trip t o the World War Two foundation in Wakefield, Rhode Island. After going to the museum, I learned many facts and overall stories I had never heard before. I had always loved learning about the war, it had always fascinated me, but going to the foundation actually showed me all of the uniforms, letters home, scrapbooks, machinery and propaganda I have seen in textbooks and heard about in the classroom. Seeing the artifacts really helped me to comprehend and put myself in the shoes of not just the soldiers but everyone else that was impacted by the war. Not to mention the veterans and employees that really helped bring the history to life. Finally, to top it all off, my class got to take a DVD home, for free! A free documentary of our choice which comes directly from the founder, Tim Gray. Overall, I can definitely see myself visiting again because going to the foundation was as if going into a time capsule into the past!” Pat Nigro – Teacher, Highlander School “Thank you so much for everything today. Today was one of, if not the, best field trips I’ve taken students on in the 6.25 years that I’ve been an educator. The students were so engaged in your collection, in pushing each other’s curiosity, and with you. You were amazing in how you spoke not to, but truly with the students. You had them all hanging on your every word and you helped make this real in a way I never could have. Thank you so much for everything. None of us will forget this, and I hope to be able to return with a new group of 10th graders around this time next year if you’ll have us back.” The non-profit International Museum of World War II , located at 344 Main Street in South Kingstown, RI, opened officially in the fall of 2018 and began offering school field trips in January of 2019.

    "homepage_content":"The Vintage Radio and Communications Museum of Connecticut 0 hands on history The Vintage Radio & Communications Museum Welcome to the Vintage Radio and Communications Museum We are an all-volunteer run museum located in Windsor, Connecticut, offering a fascinating and educational look back in time (and technology). Take a walk through history from Morse Code transmitters to radio & television to personal computers, and everything in between. UNEXPECTED EXPENSES HIT VRCMCT: GO FUND ME - VRCMCT We received unexpected news in late May 2024 that we are required to pay for the continuation of the sewer line along Pierson Lane, where the museum is located. The cost is to be split among five property owners on this stretch of road - and our portion is estimated to be $28,000, with an additional $12,000+ to connect the sewer line to the museum building itself. As an all-volunteer run museum, we do not have those funds on-hand, nor did we expect this expense to occur so quickly. The project is expected to begin immediately - Summer of 2024. We have had our share of challenges over the last 34 years of the Museum - and we are hopeful that with your help and donations, we can once again move forward with our mission to educate and share communications history with our diverse group of visitors for many years to come. Many of our displays are hands-on! Tap out your name in Morse Code; Tune a 1925 radio; Crank a wind-up phonograph; Listen to a home-made crystal set; Pick a song from a working juke box. Browse our displays and exhibits at your own pace, or take a tour with one of our knowledgeable tour guides. We have extensive collections and an impressive variety of vintage communication technology. The museum offers several classes for all ages, and has many resources to help answer your electronic communications questions.",

First known as the Great Swamp Society, the town was incorporated in 1785 and called Berlin. New Britain remained a part of the town until 1850. The early economy formed around farms, mills, and blacksmiths, and in the middle of the eighteenth century, brothers Edward and William Pattison emigrated to Berlin from Ireland and set up the first tinware business in the colonies. Today, Berlin has three distinct areas (Kensington, Berlin Center, and East Berlin), and remains both residential and industrial, with many small industries still in operation. Featured A Hip Road Trip Known as “Gasoline Alley” during the 1950s, the Berlin Turnpike boasts a heady visual mix of neon, brand names, logos, and 1960s' motel Modernism. … [more] Learn More 58529

    "homepage_content":"Connecticut Daughters of the American Revolution, NSDAR – Connecticut Daughters of the American Revolution In 2026, our nation will celebrate its 250th Anniversary . The year promises to hold many meaningful events that are equal to or better than our nation’s Bicentennial in 1976. The next several years are the key planning period as we advance towards “America 250!” in our beloved Connecticut and our 42, and growing, chapters. The National Society Daughters of the American Revolution (NSDAR or DAR) is a non-political women’s service organization dedicated to historic preservation, education, and patriotism with a strong focus on supporting veterans and members of our nation’s active military and their families. One common thread that unites all DAR members; each member can trace her family tree to someone who contributed to American independence during the American Revolutionary War. There are four ways in which an ancestor might have contributed. They might have fought in the war, helped fund the war, provided material assistance, or signed an oath of allegiance like the oath signed at Valley Forge. If you think that you have this connection to the American Revolutionary War in your family tree, we encourage you to apply for membership. Over one million women have joined the DAR since its founding in 1890. Email Membership Our activities Great things are happening within today’s DAR! With the approaching 250th anniversary of our nation, there is a renewed sense of shared purpose within our vibrant and forward-thinking organization. We hope that you will want to be a part of it! Activities are as varied as the chapters themselves. To learn more, please visit the education, patriotism, and historic preservation sections of this website.

Send your email to us! WE Celebrated with Shots heard 'round the center! ( The Sherman Historical Society’s 50th anniversary reenactment was a blast!!! (Literally, with both cannon and musket fire!) We had the perfect weather and the event was a rousing success! It was our way to celebrate and thank the community for our longevity and you showed us such appreciation with your attendance! What an outpouring of interest and support! The reenactors and colonial villagers truly brought history to life, interacting with visitors, demonstrating and answering questions about what life was like in colonial times as a community and as a young country at war for its independence. What were battles like? How did troops communicate? Who spied on whom and how? How were injuries treated? How was food preserved? How were shoes and garments and household goods made? It was a thoroughly immersive experience all around. The day opened with welcome by Society President Elizabeth M. Haney, (whose leadership orchestrated this entire event) followed by the reading of a town proclamation by First Selectman Don Lowe, and a rousing speech by founding father Roger Sherman (embodied by actor Charles Roth). This event was nearly a year in the preparation and would not have been made possible without the support of so, so very many. We wish to thank them all wholeheartedly: from all the reenactors—5th Connecticut Regiment, Ye Olde Lebanon Towne Militia Co., and the 38th (1st Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot—and colonial artisans, to our event photographers John and Masumi O'Donnell, our Scout Troop 48 food vendor, our costumer suppliers, our audio tech, our firewood fillers, and our cannon contributor. We could not have coordinated this without the phenomenal cooperation of the Town of Sherman: First Selectman Don Lowe, Park and Rec, Kris Fazzone and the Department of Emergency Services, Town Maintenance, NCLC, our parking team led by Bob Ostrosky, plus those who stepped in last minute to direct traffic, and Dave, our Shuttle driver. To the Society volunteers who cleaned up, cleaned out, built, set up—and pulled off a variety of feats to organize and stage our event. We held a \"Tavern Night\" thank you for our reenactors and sponsors and it was spearheaded by Society Volunteer Allyson M. Mard, catered by Blue on Bank (New Milford), and the audience enjoyed colonial tunes provided by talented musician and singer Jeff Butler. Of course, this would not have been possible without the understanding of the center residents as well, who put up with the noise and traffic, and offered Volunteer parking. Our neighbors, who allowed us the use of their beautiful field for the start of our skirmish (the perfect backdrop!). And last but certainly not least: our generous sponsors: the Great Circle Foundation for their grant, our “Patriot Level” sponsors: Beatty Construction Company, Club River Oaks, and Superior Spring & Manufacturing Co. Inc. We thank our additional sponsors as well: Steve Thorne (to honor past president Gloria Thorne), Lori Finck, UBS, Jennings Oil & Propane, Collins-Morrow Insurance, Inc., Hair by Suzi, and Norbert E. Mitchell, Co. Inc. We couldn't have done it without your partnership! Thank you for celebrating with us! We are 50 years old and 50 years young! Here’s to continuing to preserve and present Sherman’s History. Pictured above: British Troops advance during the afternoon skirmish. Below, Society President Elizabeth M. Haney addresses the assembly, flanked by First Selectman Don Lowe and Patriot Troops from the 5th Connecticut Regiment. \"As President of the Sherman Historical Society, what excites me most from this tremendously successful reenactment, is seeing history come alive for our community. The day brought together neighbors, friends, students, families, and visitors who were able to step back into 1775 and truly experience the sights, sounds and spirit of our town's past. I'm especially proud of how many Sherman organizations, sponsors, volunteers, and participants joined forces with the SHS to make this event not just a reenactment, but a shared celebration of our heritage.\" —Elizabeth M. Haney We'll finish off our 50th with our Holiday Open House & Barn event in December. Decorations, desserts, open hearth cooking, good friends and good cheer! Then we look ahead to C elebrating our Nation's 250th in 2026 with focus on founding father Roger Sherman, and a concert of period music. Stay tuned for more! Come join us as we celebrate 50, 250 and beyond! Annual Meeting, September 25, 2025 The annual meeting of the membership was held at Northrop House, Thursday, September 25, 2025 at 7pm. It was a brief meeting with reports from the President and other officers of the Board. At this meeting, three new board members were elected: Alan Braverman , Bernadette Linero , and Richard Lenihan . We welcome them and the new energy they bring to the Board. Also recognized—due & overdue—our volunteers of the year(s): For 2023\/24, HelenAnne Ostrosky and for 2024\/25: Dick Haney (pictured at right.) HelenAnne has been a longtime member of the Society and the Board who brings high energy and commitment to all she does and she does so very much! Dick, whose last name you'll recognize, humbly says he was \"conscripted by marriage\" to the Society president, but he has stepped up as a stalwart volunteer in every sense and for every event and program that the Society has held for the last several years. Muscle, heart and brains fit both our honorees and we appreciate them! For more on each. If anyone would like a copy of the annual report, please email the Soci ety.

It’s a place where neighbors become friends and strangers become familiar faces. In an era where digital interactions often take precedence, the old-fashioned charm of The Old Store reminds us of the value of human connections forged over a wooden countertop. Your patronage, year after year, plays a vital role in keeping The Old Store Museum & Gift Shop operational, much like a lifeblood pumping through the veins of a cherished community landmark. The Old Store Museum is a living museum, where the walls whisper tales of past generations and the creaky floorboards groan with the weight of time. By choosing to shop with us, staffed 100% by volunteers, locals and visitors alike contribute to the maintenance of a tangible piece of the town’s heritage. Each purchase made is a vote for the continuation of this legacy, allowing the store to remain a beacon of Sherman’s storied past amidst the ever-evolving present. The mission of The Old Store Gift Shop is to be self-sufficient, pay all of its expenses while maintaining the over 200-year-old building and provide funds for the SHS endowment as well as programs for SHS as needed. Your purchases helped us replace a section of The Old Store’s roof and will help toward adding air-conditioning to our second floor where we now house a wonderful exhibit. Each transaction is a declaration of support for a way of life that values authenticity, relationships, and the rich tapestry of our heritage. Come see us, shop for the gift you need (we get new items every week) and we might have just the right gift. And we wrap for no charge. Remember, we “have a little of a lot,” we change with the seasons and the holidays are fast approaching!! ​ NEW BOOK: Lake Mauweehoo History by John Cilio and Ann Price is available for purchase. BOOK RE-RELEASED. We are pleased to reprint the late James Lincoln Collier’s earlier publication, The Bohemians of Robber Rocks , in which he provides an insightful look back at our local history, from colonial times to the colorful 1930s—when a menagerie of Bohemian writers, artists, and actors of note took up residence at the seventeenth century homestead, Robber Rocks , that lies on the Pawling\/Sherman border. It is a personal retelling that complements our 2022 book, Reflections, that is filled with personal stories of locals from that era, from the quiet dignity of Edna Barnes to the wild antics of the Bohemians. Both books are available at The Old Store, $30 each. The Old Store Museum & Gift Shop is located at 3 Route 37 Center in Sherman. Our hours are Friday through Sunday from 12 to 4. Hope to see you soon! TO CONTACT US: 860-350-3475 or email 2024 EXHIBIT: \"MEMORIES OF THE GENERAL STORE\" The Society has mounted a three-location exhibit to celebrate over 100 years of the General Store (and its many lives) in Sherman. The main display in Northrop House, which features a variety of stores once in the area, is open Sat. and Sun. 1-3. The Old Store houses all the items left to the Society from what was Lester Bennett’s IGA as well as many vintage photos. The Old Store is open Fri. through Sun. 12-4. The third part is a display at the current GA, on the shelf over the meat counter. Have a look next time you shop! The Society was pleased to add to this exhibit, a section to mark Mike Luzi’s 41st year owning the current IGA and his dedication to our town. We encourage you to visit all the exhibits, which run through October Click here for a video of Mike Luzi's visit to the exhibit. MEET OUR NEW BOARD MEMBERS At our Annual Meeting in September, we elected three additional Board Members to our governing team: Renée Collins, Lucy Seda and Helen Anne Ostrosky . They each bring unique talents and energy to the table. (Please see page 8 for a full list of our Board.) Renée Collins has called Sherman home for the past four decades. Currently, she is a dedicated volunteer at The Old Store. She raised two children here and has proudly served as a realtor helping families find their dream homes and invest in the beauty of this town. Lucy Seda, her husband and two teens have taken delight in Sherman since their move in 2018. Lucy works in the healthcare field. She believes, however, her best work has taken place through volunteerism. Helen Anne Ostrosky has lived in Sherman since 1999, and has raised four children here. She currently works as an Assistant Preschool Teacher at Christ Church Preschool in Pawling NY. Helen Anne began volunteering at SHS with Membership and Kids@Cobbler Shop programs. She teamed up to start the Hooked on History children’s programs. She looks forward to collaborating with the current and past board members and volunteers! PROGRAMS, EVENTS, AND MORE HAPPENINGS AROUND THE SHS We still have much to do to get back to our programs, including volunteers to help us run them. If you are inter-ested, contact us. This past year, SHS co-sponsored with the Sherman Library, John Cilio’s informative talk on Taverns and their role in colonial life in New England, and highlighted those right here in Sherman. Did you know the library sits on the land once occupied by Fuller’s Tavern? We hope to sponsor more of these talks. Our annual Holiday Open House took place on December 2nd, 3rd, and 9th, 2023, featuring a special visit from Santa, who joined us for the community Christmas Tree and Menorah lighting. Our theme, “A Stroll Down Memory Lane,” offered a festive and nostalgic way to welcome the community and express our heartfelt thanks for your continued support of our volunteer organization. It was a wonderful way to usher in the holiday season, and we hope you enjoyed it as much as we did. We’re already planning this year’s theme and look forward to creating another memorable experience for you! Our Annual Fundraising Barn Sale was a tremendous success, and we extend our deepest thanks to everyone who made it possible. From the generous donations we received to the enthusiastic buyers who turned out in droves, your support was invaluable. We’re especially grateful to the dedicated volunteers who worked tirelessly for weeks to prepare, setting up and taking down the tent, organizing the sale, and ensuring everything ran smoothly. Thanks to effective publicity, the word got out—and you all made it a success. Even the weather was perfect! One loyal customer in line confessed, “This is my favorite day of the year. Not my birthday, not Christmas, but your annual barn sale. No matter where I am, I’d take the red-eye back just to be here.” How can we not feel the love? In addition, SHS hosted Sherman School’s 2nd Grade visit and the 4th & 5th Grade’s Colonial Days event. We look forward to hosting more educational events to inspire and enlighten our community in addition to our historic 50th anniversary planning, which just might prove to be—Revolutionary! If you have an historic collection or are interested in presenting a history lecture or workshop, let us know . NOrthrop House gets some pampering The Northrop House Museum was closed for a good while this past year to make necessary repairs and upgrades. These were made possible by a generous grant from the Ada Howe Kent Foundation. The water damage to the ceiling in the upstairs bedroom w as repaired, the room repainted and the floors refinished. After Holiday Open House, the exhibit room and parlor were emptied of furniture so that both rooms could be repainted. We then added the bathroom into the mix where both repairs and painting were warranted. Railings were installed to the attic, as was much-needed lighting. Office lighting was repaired and both exhibit room and basement were made brighter with upgraded fixtures. It was a huge undertaking and we appreciate all who lent their skills to the job: Bill & Ken from Linke’s Painting; Mike Koraus Plumbing; Todd Russell for the electrical; and Jan Desiato for his overseeing the work and making the much needed carpentry repairs. We'll be thanking more folks next newsletter as we continue to get ourselves back into shape! Image Credit: Marie Loria Did You Know... The NEW Roger Sherman Learning Center This rendering was done by our local graphic designer, Marie Loria, who, incidentally lives with her family on the property that was, 275 years ago, the Roger Sherman farm. It is a time line display which shows the trades that Roger Sherman mastered and the contributions he made in his public life. The cabinet surrounding the time line has now been completed by Jan Desiato. This time line display is the centerpiece of our Roger Sherman Learning Center. Accompanying the time line is a downloadable audio that adds a wealth of detail about Roger Sherman's life, his family, the places where he lived and a sampling of documents and artifacts related to his life. The display is open to the public by appointment only, it is accompanied by period furnishings, all with connections to residents of Sherman, photographs of early and contemporary Sherman Residents and descendants of Roger Sherman. It has a computer based research center which contains our growing collection of Sherman's documents (transcribed for readability), local oral histories and the barns of Sherman, all of which have been photographed. The center space is used for educational purposes for Sherman School students, public programs and special exhibits. Photo Credit: Yale University Art Gallery Did You Know... Roger Sherman...'The Forgotten Founding Father.' By John Jenner It has been noted by Roger Sherman's biographers that he is \"The Forgotten Founding Father\". If we knew what he had contributed to the founding of our nation we would think of him as the Great Connecticut Statesman, our most important revolutionary hero. What did he contribute? He served in the Continental Congress from its first meeting in 1774, through the Revolutionary War. Washington fought the war. but the Continental Congress ran the war and provided the weaponry, food, uniforms and finance. Roger Sherman was the only founder to sign all four of the founding documents and he played a significant roll in each of them. The first was the \"Articles of Association\". The thirteen colonies had many border disputes that had to be resolved before colonies could unite to declare their independence as a committed set of thirteen states. Perhaps the greatest border dispute was the CT grant that extended westward across the upper half of Pennsylvania to Lake Erie. CT gave up these rights, holding only their portion of what is now Ohio. This is the Western Reserve, where CT citizen were given opportunities after the war. Our second founding document was \"The Declaration of Independence\" . We generally attribute it to Thomas Jefferson but, in fact, it was a committee of five statesmen who created it. They were: Jefferson; John Adams; Benjamin Franklin; Robert Livingston and Roger Sherman. If you still have a two dollar bill tucked away and look on the back you’ll find a copy of the painting by our own John Trumball depicting the committee presenting the draft to John Hancock. Our constitution is not the first one under which we were governed as a nation after the Revolutionary War. The first was \"The Articles of Confederation\", and there were thirteen Heads of State before Washington. It did not work well because the balance of power between the states and the central government had not been properly crafted. Concerned leaders convinced Washington to convene the Constitutional Convention to draft a new constitution. The states representatives were deadlocked over the states vs. federal balance as before until Roger Sherman again proposed \"The Great Compromise\", which provides for proportional representation in the House and equal representation in the Senate. The deadlock was resolved, the \"U.S. Constitution\" was drafted, signed and taken back to the states for ratification. CT, under Roger Sherman's leadership, was the second state to ratify our constitution. When George Washington was elected first President under our present constitution and the first Congress was seated, Roger Sherman was a CT Representative in the House. After a year or so one of our CT Senators resigned and Roger Sherman was selected to take his seat in the Senate, where he served until his death. Your may recall that James Madison is credited with drafting the first ten amendments to our constitution, which we call \"The Bill of Rights\". A few years ago a draft copy of Madison's proposed nine rights was discovered in the National Archives among the Madison papers. It had Roger Sherman's comments and a suggested tenth right. Wouldn't you like to know which one he proposed? Doesn't it seem to you that Roger Sherman should be recognized as one of our Founding Fathers? He served in public office almost fifty years and that is longer than any of our other recognized Founding Fathers. Our Mission To bring together people interested in Sherman's history, to collect and preserve objects which help to establish or illustrate its history, to acquire and manage any property available to the Society, to interest young people in their town's heritage, to publish historical information, and to maintain a library of historical materials.

Upcoming Tours Programs & Events LEARN MORE Help us plant seeds for the future by sponsoring a zinnia plant today! The Bellamy-Ferriday House & Garden started its life as the Bellamy Manse, built by Reverend Joseph Bellamy. A preacher of great renown, Bellamy traveled throughout New England preaching the message of the First Great Awakening. His writings were published in New York, Boston, and Scotland. He built the house in two stages, beginning in 1754 and finishing in 1767 as his family, theological seminary, and stature grew. The property increased to 100 acres and was owned by his family for a century. In 1912, New Yorkers Henry and Eliza Ferriday purchased the property as a summer residence for themselves and their only child Caroline. Beginning when she was 9 years old, Caroline Ferriday spent 78 summers on the property. The Ferriday family updated the house with modern amenities such as heat, electricity, and plumbing. Eliza and Caroline designed a formal parterre garden which features historic roses, peonies, lilacs, and numerous fragrant trees and shrubs. Interested in the life of Bellamy, Caroline researched and collected antiques related to Reverend Bellamy’s life, many of which are still on display in the house. Caroline Ferriday supported many social justice and human rights causes. In particular, she supported the Free France Movement during World War II and secured medical assistance for survivors of Ravensbrück concentration camp. These survivors, many of which were horribly disfigured, were able to start their lives again thanks to the philanthropy of Caroline Ferriday. She received the Cross of Lorraine and the French Legion of Honor medal for her efforts. A fictionalized account of Caroline’s life, focusing on her work with the women of Ravensbrück, is chronicled in the New York Times best-selling book Lilac Girls by Martha Hall Kelly. Kelly also wrote two more historic-fiction novels, Lost Roses and Sunflower Sisters which tell stories of Eliza Ferriday and the Woolsey Sisters, respectively. Page load link Go to Top",

Looking up, we see a plain brown house, built square, and two stories high with a great stone chimney at the top. Shall we go up the step and knock at the door? It would be useless, they would not hear us for the dear old house, built by my grandfather’s grandfather nearly two hundred years ago is at last deserted. Yet happy memories of the happy days spent under its hospitable roof come often to those who once knew and loved it as home and to whom it is still dear.\" Gennie Waldo 1871 Edward Waldo House Prologue Genevieve Waldo was seventeen when she wrote this bittersweet reflection about the Waldo House, the homestead her ancestors had built in 1715. Her bachelor uncle had died leaving the house empty. She had grown up in the old house with her parents and doting elderly aunt and uncle but now lived “down the lane” in a house her father, George, had built in 1857. It was a sad time in this house. Gennie had heard her parents talk about leaving Waldo Valley and moving to her mother’s family house on Long Island. The Sprague Manufacturing Company, owner of the world’s largest textile mill, five miles down the Shetucket River, was threatening to raise its dam and flood their fields. The company even planned to build another, maybe even two, enormous mills just one half mile up the river. Sprague had already bought nearby property from another Waldo cousin and although Gennie’s father had never entertained the mill’s offer to buy their house, he seemed resigned to the inevitable. George Waldo House 1857 Twenty years earlier, Waldos had fought the mill owners’ first expansion into their countryside. They had fought Sprague’s railroad taking by eminent domain a one and one-half mile right of way through the middle of their farmlands and they lost. They then had fought the mill’s water rights privileges to flood their farmlands and they lost. Later, they had won in court a small compensation against the mill after it had torn down one of the family’s most important possessions, its sawmill. But these new encroachments were just too much, too big, they would have to leave their grandfather’s grandfather’s land. Gennie’s world seemed to be coming to an end in another more poignant way. The youngest of this family’s children had recently died in infancy. Gennie’s grief stricken mother was gone to recuperate for long periods of time leaving Gennie, the eldest daughter, to raise with her spinster aunt her five siblings who ranged in age from 7 to 15. Although her father’s transcendental religion saved him from a sense of despair, it could not save him from the mysterious disease that bound him to a wheel chair. History Gennie's Family Even knowing all these troubles, Gennie could not understand why her parents were considering abandoning the house and Waldo Valley. She was proud of her family’s past and of the house that had always been theirs. Everything seemed so permanent. After all, the house wasn’t just old, it was ancient. Inside the attic’s trunks, there were deeds, inventories, account books that told the story of their search for land, starting with Cornelius’, the Waldo patriarch, migration from England to the New World in 1643. Cornelius’ son, John and his wife, Rebecca Adams, were among the early English settlers from the colonial towns on Massachusetts Bay, in the wake of King Phillip’s War of 1675 -1677, to permanently settle and farm the area. They arrived in time to take part in a fury of real estate transactions just twenty years after the Mohegan Sachem Joshua, son of Uncas, bequeathed to the “sixteen gentlemen of Norwich the Eight Miles Broad”. This Sachem’s generosity left his children so destitute that his son, Abimelech, was forced to sell his remaining land, 10,000 acres called Mamasqueeg. Gennie knew of a few remaining, “squatting” royal Mohegans high in the hills surrounding her valley but they were “poor Indians”, too poor to claim anyone’s land. A century after Cornelius’ arrival, his family was flourishing. The average mid-1700s farm was 40 acres and a large farm had 70. But with hard work with large powerful hands, sound farming practices, and a few good real estate deals, Edward was able to expand his farm to over 500 acres. But this good fortune was now changing. As Gennie held these ancient fragile documents of ownership, she realized that what had happened to the Native Americans could happen to her family. Edward Waldo Deed 1705 The old leather, sheep skinned trunks held together with diamond headed nails also held the precious memories of her ancestors’ lives. Neatly stacked in rows were hundreds of their letters. Among them was a sorrowful letter from her great aunt Eunice in Illinois detailing her husband’s early death and pleading to come home with her six children. Congregational minister, Daniel Waldo, sent evangelical letters describing his fights with the Baptists and efforts to convert the Indians in New York. Like Eunice, Daniel wrote of the terrible deaths due to epidemics and expressed faith that salvation was certain for those who “die in the Lord”. Her Uncle Giles’ letters describe his voyages to the South Seas searching for fame and then his return to the Gold Rush desperate for fortune. They all begged for news about the family and the homestead, knowing they would not hear back for months. Gennie was also worried that if the house slipped out of Waldo hands, future descendants would forget about them and their other accomplishments. She had been told, for example, of her grandfather’s grandfather’s contributions to the early colony, his appointment as a lieutenant in the town’s militia for his Majesty’s (King George) Service, in 1720 and his service as deputy for the town to the Connecticut General Assembly during the 1720s. She had heard how, a couple of generations later, her ancestors had overcome their English loyalties and ardently supported the Revolution. Her great grandfather, the Reverend Ebenezer Devotion, had preached against the tyranny of British rule, a cause for which her grandfather, the Esquire Ebenezer Devotion Jr., had agitated. The minister fought the British taxes at the pulpit and the Esquire joined the Sons of Liberty and supplied the Continental Army from his store. She had read the colorful Revolutionary War letters her four great Waldo uncles sent home describing some of their battles in this war. And then there was the most inspiring and improbable of all stories, the rise of Samuel Huntington, her great great uncle and also first cousin twice removed, (colonial genealogies were often complicated by multiple marriages of two families) from small town boy to patriot and signer of the Declaration of Independence. Huntington went on to be the first president of the breakaway colonies, leading the Continental Congress, and later became Governor of Connecticut. Waldo House Attic From the many probated inventories of her male ancestors (colonial women could not own property) , Gennie could trace the growth of her families “wealth”. Along with their land which was the most valuable asset, their livestock grew considerably from just an oxen, a horse, and a few sheep to 2 oxen, several horses, 50 cows, 60 1 year olds, and many sheep. Household furniture gentrified from simple banner back chairs to Windsors, from square to round tables to a high chest desk, one great chair, and several featherbeds all crafted by local artisan furniture makers. Clothing improved from an essential large coat to several formal velvet jackets and from an essential pair of boots to several pair of shoes with silver buckles. Gennie was not surprised that the books were mostly religious – The Great Bible, sermons, psalms, hymns, but also a dictionary, some literature, and many childrens’ books. Perhaps what was most significant to Gennie was what was not listed - these Waldos did not own slaves. Along with many of the other leading families of this colonial period, Gennie’s maternal great grandparents (Devotions) had a male slave to help with manual labor and a female slave to spin the wool and clean the house and her several great Waldo grandfather had a young slave girl in Boston but the Waldos of this Waldo House, these Separatists, evangelical Christians, who abandoned themselves to God and lived Christ’s Gospels one of which said that no man could own another. Gennie knew the profound effect that this peculiar institution had not only on the slaves but also on those who eventually fought for its abolition. Her grandparents had sent her father and uncle to very early abolitionist schools where they worked, lived, and studied with freed slaves in the early 1830ies. They became early members of the American Anti-Slavery Society in 1833. They sought immediate unequivocal emancipation. These ideas would have been considered radical by the vast majority of Americans at that time. Although Connecticut had over 3,000 slaves in 1776, it was one of the first states to emancipate their slaves in 1784 with the Gradual Emancipation Act. It stated that those children born into slavery after March 1 st , 1784 would be free by the time they turn 25. As a result, slavery in Connecticut was practiced until 1848 but it took a Civil War with over 700,000 dead to kill “slavery dead” throughout the country. Her father George believed deeply that “Jehovah would triumph and free his people”. Gennie's Tour As if anticipating her family’s final abandonment of their ancestral home, Gennie takes her imagined readers on a tour first describing the grounds surrounding the house. There is “a tiny rose bush struggling with vines and weeds, trying to tell us what it once was”. She then asks rhetorically, “who can be the owner to leave everything to such wild neglect”? She proceeds inside, starting in the parlor. “The Room seems musty and feels to have suddenly stepped back into a room of the last century….grandmother’s looking glass with its quilt frame hangs between the two South windows. The American Eagle with outspread wings rests upon the top, his once brilliant plumage sadly tarnished, and well it might be for when first he spread his golden wings at the top of that ancient mirror, our national bird was in his glorious youth. Poor bird is he tired, standing for more than seventy years with outspread wings? Does he not long to fold them now and sink to rest?” Her melancholy for the old house expands to despair for her entire country. The Civil War, which had ended six years earlier, seems to tarnish her family’s significant accomplishments during the colonial era and her father’s abolitionism. She points out, against the opposite wall, her “grandfather’s bookcase, a strange piece of old fashioned furniture, a table, a bureau, a bookcase and a writing desk combined”. Its books reflected the range of Waldo interests: histories, literature, sacred scriptures, Greek and Latin texts, school books, children’s stories and documents on the Revolution. Gennie underscores the peculiar frozen nature of the room by describing “the fine looking family portraits nearly life sized, standing floor to ceiling“ and then finally “the old silent mysterious clock not wound in years. What tales of other years it might tell if it only would?” Oddly, Gennie leaves out one detail on her tour; the oldest piece of furniture in the parlor, her grandfather’s grandfather’s Deacon Chair with the initials EW on the back of the crest. Edward had once removed and then returned this chair to his Congregational Church because of a spiritual crisis. As a Separatist during the First Great Awakening, he claimed the right to speak in meeting and to hear exhorters preach to him. Excommunicated by his church, he would eventually make confession and be reinstated. Edward’s apostasy and return to the fold reminded her too much of her own father’s spiritual battles. George had been swept up in the Second Great Awakening, struggled mightily with his faith, only to outgrow the exhorters, distain populist revival meetings and never return to the fold. He writes in his Journal: “I went to church and heard an orthodox parrot speak of exclamations and humdrum phrases which I have heard repeated over and over again ever since my father was a baby. I shall not do it again. My Sabbath shall hereafter be spent roaming the fields, talking with myself, with God, reading-writing- praising-praying silently. I will not murder myself for the sake of gratifying others.” 1843 Edward Waldo’s Deacon Chair After his brother, Giles, meet and corresponded for two years with Ralph Waldo Emerson, another distant relative, the brothers left behind stern Calvinism for the intuitive, individual, nature-worshiping path of Transcendentalism. Gennie didn’t mind that the locals thought of her as one of the godless Waldos because she felt fortunate to grow up in a family that believed that God was present in nature and people, particularly in children’s souls. She was revered as a child. Although she would have been responsible for helping her mother with the household chores and helping her father on the farm, her most important duty was to be herself. She was instructed well in her ABCs but always encouraged to think for herself. Her father taught her well about the godliness of her valley. He took her on many walks like this one described in his Journal: “Come and walk with me and see the white clover everywhere thick among the green grass, the river glistening through the maples, and the hill rising up beyond wonderful grassland and grain land and trees that have walked out there in their sleep and now stand dreaming over the valley. You hear the notes of the wood thrush – they are perpetual here – ringing clear and sweet from the depths of the woods into the deeps of life. (1857) They looked and thought deeply; the trees walked and dreamt and the birds spoke to their souls. They could hear the river breathing in the distance and feel the hills embracing them. They could hear the silences of the ages and feel the subtle magnetism in nature. Here they were no longer owners of the land, the land owned them. The House Survives The natural beauty of Waldo Valley that Gennie experienced as a child remains to this day. And the old Waldo house that Gennie was so worried about was saved. The Sprague Manufacturing Company, builder of the largest textile mill in the world, had become overextended with debt and collapsed in the Depression of 1873. The mill building itself would collapse a few years later after heavy rains swelled the Shetucket River to biblical levels and the dam that the company had raised failed and washed away part of this mill. And the house did not remain deserted much longer as Gennie’s younger brother, Gerald, would graduate from Cornell University, earning a B.Ag and farm both homesteads until the 1940’s. By that time, Connecticut farms were dying out due to the competition of large scale western farms. After all the gifts of land to successive generations, the farm was down to 200 acres consisting of 80 in pasture, 30 in hay, 20 in grains, 10 in fruit orchards and 60 in woodlands. A 1939 Waldo Farm Income Statement briefly states: expenses $4337.04 income $3190.51 loss $1146.53 due to more hens killed and lower egg prices. Gerald would be the last farmer. He was proud that he was still able to keep the farm, keep the land. He was born knowing who he was, his confidence rooted in the land. He walked the same paths that his ancestors had walked. He plowed the same fields his ancestors had worked 250 years earlier. Waldo Farm Barns Waldo House Painting Giles Waldo Genealogy 1834 The old house remained in the Waldo family till 1975 when Ruth, Gerald’s daughter and Gennie’s niece, bequeathed it with a small endowment to a state historical society “to preserve the dwelling house, to be known as the Edward Waldo House, as a landmark of historical value and interest and employed solely for educational, benevolent, scenic and other philanthropic purposes”. But once again the survival of the house along with its contents became doubtful. This historical society with its patrician directors and its powerful lawyers voted three years later to divest itself of the property and sell it. After Waldo descendants argued about “fiduciary responsibilities”, it deeded in trust the property to a newly formed local historical society. Ruth gave the land, which was never flooded by man-made causes, to the State of Connecticut to remain as open space in perpetuity. So today the house, a classic full two story, two room deep, central chimney New England farmhouse is a museum with a collection of art, papers, letters, books, furniture, textiles and farming equipment reflecting the taste and history of the seven generations of this family. Built by Edward Waldo (1684-1767) in 1715, the house passed to Zacheus (1715-1810) to Ebenezer (1766-1843) to Ebenezer (1798-1866) to George (1816-1886) to Gerald (1855-1942) and to Ruth (1885-1975). Today the Scotland Historical Society manages the house and trust. In a few years, we will celebrate the house’s tercentennial. The Tour Today Today a visitor can see some of the pieces of furniture that Gennie saw and described in 1871. Normally, a tour starts in the old kitchen, the largest room in the house with its giant fireplace, eight feet wide, five feet tall, raked out every night to preserve the coals for the cold morning, its massive stones warming up the entire first floor. Double hung doors could be opened so that a pair of oxen could haul in the 18” back logs which also helped to hold the fire’s heat all night. It is amazing that the house never burned down; perhaps the ever present wooden bucket of water was used on more than one occasion. The old kitchen was the busiest room in the house, the true heart of the house where generations both worked and lounged. Here perhaps were the happier days that Gennie wants us to remember. A small “birthing” room next to the kitchen saw 36 Waldo births. Here is where the fruits of the harvest from the stingy soil would be chopped, pickled and preserved, where a kettle would always be simmering above the fire and the brick oven warm for baking. Here the aged would mend, perhaps humming psalms together while the young were told to read. Close by the well room, with its barrel full of water and its improbably large hooks for the salmon caught from the river. Then the tool room with its work benches for mending and finally the buttery where bi-weekly, huge quantities of cheese and butter were made in large discs to be carried by ox cart the twelve miles to the whaling ships in Norwich. In these rooms, the family lived out its philosophy that hard work, duty and simple living were the source of dignity and the solutions to any problem. Waldo House Fireplace Kenneth Waldo World War One Letter Gennie’s tour leaves out the upstairs and the garret but a visitor today can see the homespun textiles, the sweetly laced baby clothes, the impossibly small wedding dress, the intricately sewn blankets, one with over 16,000 squares sown by a thirteen year old Waldo. There is a recently constructed library for the family’s collection of books. In the corner of the attic there is a small bedroom where Kenneth, the last Waldo to live in this house would sometimes take refuge. He was a World War One veteran, wounded and shell shocked, and would never be quite the same. After his parent’s death, he lived alone in the house and enjoyed the simple gifts of his natural surroundings. He walked the old Indian trails to hidden trout streams and hunted and trapped for wild game in the hemlock forest. The town’s people might have thought him a little odd but he had sacrificed for his country and some of the Waldos had been a little different. When they did see him in town he seemed to have a twinkle in his eye, a full smile and told a good Yankee joke. Gennie concludes her tour of the house…”but we cannot stay longer, the shadows lengthen, and the golden sunlight coming in at the west window grows fainter…we must draw the blinds and bid the old homestead good night, leaving it to itself once more and its unspoken memories of better days.” Kin Keeper Gennie is what the professionals in American Family Studies call a kin keeper. She preserved the family’s past for its future. Although many generations helped in this pursuit, she is perhaps the most unsung one. She never married and except for teaching for a few years after college and working as a stenographer in New York City later in her life, she lived here in Waldo Valley, where she helped raise her many nieces and nephews, cared for the aged of her multi-generational family, particularly her father who was a wheelchair bound invalid for the last twenty years of his life. She also transcribed hundreds of his letters, which had been returned to the house because as her father, George, said “so that my children may not be so ignorant of me as I unwillingly am of my father”. He was also a kin keeper. There are many fragile, old scrapes of paper, fragments of the Waldos’ lives, in the old house. On one four by two inch note with large handwriting slanting left, attached to one of Gennie’s last bequests she wrote, “This small package of old silver may be divided among my nephews and nieces” - Genevieve Waldo, Scotland, October 28 th , 1932 (my mother’s hundred and tenth birthday) Gennie (First from left) with her Sisters – 1915 Her mother had been dead for 34 years. Gennie dies the next year. The old silver is gone but this reflection on the old Waldo house celebrates Gennie’s hundred and fiftieth-eighth birthday. In another of her kin keeping bequests, she gave to my grandmother, her niece, a thirty acre piece of land, part of the original Waldo homestead, where my grandparents built on a hill the fourth and last Waldo house in this valley. They would also more than double the Waldos’ original land purchases during the early 20 th century but that is another story. They gave most of their land to the State of Connecticut to remain as forest in perpetuity. I look across the old farm fields to two old Waldo houses,“ the river and the hills beyond in this valley which has many “dear happy memories”. I think Gennie and my grandmother would be one of the Waldos to thank me for this reflection. Some twentieth century Waldos would tell me to burn it and get on with my own life. In their self-made- man culture, ancestral reflections become ancestor worship. The Waldos were no better or worse than most. Some smart and able, some were not. Postscript Waldo Valley is remarkably unchanged since Edward traveled east six miles down the Shetucket River from his father’s homestead in Windham to a forested wilderness and built his strong post and beam house. Summer beams and heavy framing with counter corner posts are visible. The house stands alone with no man-made structures in view in contrast to his father’s house, surrounded by housing developments and gravel operators. The river with help from the last glaciers of 10,000 years ago created a broad river valley with rich flood plain fields. Some of the old fields are still farmed although some, as they all will someday, have reverted to woodlands. Black Walnut Tree Waldo Valley A handsome, oldest documented (1798) Black Walnut tree in the State of Connecticut, casts its broad shadow over the house and land. The barns are gone. On the eastern boundary is a large farm, to the west the river, and the hills embrace all. Perhaps the greatest legacy the Waldos left us has been their land bequests to the state of Connecticut’s Department of Environmental Protection. Over 1,000 acres are now protected in perpetuity. This area is called the Mohegan State Forest. The Waldos have preserved their land for their children’s children, for everyone’s children. Cornelius Waldo landed at Ipswich, Massachusetts in the 1640s when there were approximately 20,000 inhabitants of this colony. Today after fourteen generations, genealogists estimate that there are hundreds of thousands of Waldo decedents in this country.

The Scotland Historical Society opens the Waldo House the first Saturday from May to September and there is a Scottish Highland Festival on the grounds in October.

Inside are the original furnishings ranging from Connecticut-crafted colonial furniture to Victorian-era toys and paintings to samurai armor acquired during a trip to Japan. The objects were accumulated over the course of almost two centuries by members of this extraordinary clan, which included physicians, industrialists, missionaries, artists, globetrotters and pioneering educators and social reformers. The house’s exterior looks much as it did when it was built in 1782. Behind the property is a restored Victorian ornamental garden, originally planned to incorporate the vestiges of an earlier garden by pioneering landscape architect Jacob Weidenmann in 1865. Today, the garden is cared for by the West Hartford Garden Club. The Butler-McCook House is now the oldest remaining home in Hartford. In fact, two of only four remaining 18th-century buildings in Hartford have been preserved thanks to the care of the McCook family. In addition to their family home, they also offered their backyard to preserve the Amos Bull House, which now serves as the headquarters for Connecticut Landmarks. Page load link Go to Top",

A dramatic rally led to a hard-fought Confederate victory, with over 3,000 casualties. Visit this historic battlefield to walk where heroes fought and history was forged. Donate Become a Member Learn More The Cedar Mountain Battlefield Foundation is a community-based non-profit corporation dedicated to working cooperatively with landowners and local citizens to protect, restore, maintain, manage, interpret, and promote public awareness of the Cedar Mountain Civil War Battlefield and the vicinity of Culpeper County, Virginia. At Cedar Mountain, Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson led his troops into battle on August 9, 1862 against Nathaniel Banks’ corps of John Pope’s new Army of Virginia. Over 3,000 men were killed or wounded that afternoon and evening in the shadow of Cedar Mountain during the deadliest day in Culpeper’s history. Culpeper’s native son, Major General A. P. Hill, sealed the Confederate victory when his division reformed Jackson’s crumbled line and led the charge that turned the tide of the battle. For Hill and the other Culpeper men engaged, this was a personal battle to liberate their homes, friends and family from the Union occupation.

Architectural Style: Shingle Style, Norman History of Hearthstone Castle source; Wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hearthstone_Castle First known as “Sanford Castle”, Hearthstone was designed and constructed as a summer estate between 1895 and 1899 by architect Ernest G.W. Dietrich for Elias Starr Sanford , and his wife Emma. Sanford a Danbury native, achieved success and a national reputation as a society portrait photographer in New York City as a partner in the firm of Davis & Sanford. In 1895, at the height of his success, Sanford purchased eighteen acres of woodland at “Mountain End,” a rocky promontory that overlooks the southern part of Danbury. Two acres were cleared but the property was left ungraded except in the immediate vicinity of the building. Construction of castle commenced in the fall of 1895 and was completed in June 1899. The castle was intended to be a honeymoon “cottage” for Sanford’s wife. Sanford and his family owned the castle for only five years before selling it to Victor Buck, a retired New York industrialist. Mrs. Sanford is reported to have disliked the castle. Circa 1900 Postcard c1900 When the Buck family moved in, they renamed the castle “Buck’s Castle.” The Bucks used it as a summer residence until 1918. Bucks Castle In 1910, Charles Darling Parks bought the neighboring Tarrywile Mansion from Dr. William C. Wiles. Later, in 1918, C.D. Parks then bought “Buck’s Castle”. During this time the castle was renamed “Hearthstone Castle.” The name was possibly changed due to the eight fireplaces, which were all made out of stone, as was the rest of the castle. All of the rock that was used to build the castle was quarried on-site and transported the short distance across the property on a small railroad which was built solely for this purpose. All of the woodwork throughout the building of the castle was brought in from Italy. All of the wrought iron chandeliers, lamps, and wall sconces were made in at a silver plating factory on 17 Rowan in Danbury by Cephas B. Rogers Co. Cephas B. Rogers would in 1934, donate 25 acres of swampy land that would later be known as Rogers Park . Original Description **Note: Hearthstone Castle is currently lying in ruins and barely resembles the following description. Visitors are not allowed beyond the fenced-in property for their own safety. Trespassing is not allowed. Hearthstone Castle is a three-story, sixteen room stone castle with associated outbuildings built between 1895 and 1899. It is located in a wooded setting at the crest of a hill to the east of Brushy Hill Road in Danbury, Connecticut. The complex is centered on the castle, which is essentially early Norman in form but incorporates elements of many periods of castle architecture as well as features commonly associated with styles of the late nineteenth century. Outbuildings, all Shingles style, include a caretaker’s cottage, carriage house, pump-house, barn, woodshed, and water tower, clustered on higher ground to the south of the main building. Carriage House Carriage House for Hearthstone Castle The spacious, open veranda, from which towns far to the north could be sighted, provided a setting as well for summer parties. The eminence upon which Hearthstone Castle is built is approximately 650′ above sea level and commands panoramic views to the north and east. A steep 800′ long gravel driveway ascends to the buildings, which cannot be seen from the road. The castle occupies the brow of the hill, it’s retaining wall which is a direct continuation of the steep hillside, and then curves across the north side. The significance of the castle’s design reflects a nineteenth-century taste among newly rich Americans for palatial country residences, as well as the late Romantic taste for rusticity and exoticism. The estate’s grounds were left largely in their natural state, and the castle itself is referred to in the deed from the Sanfords to the Bucks as “the Lodge”. The rough quality of the castle’s fieldstone exterior and wood-shingled walls of the outbuildings reinforce this emphasis on natural textures and on a harmonious relationship with the weeded, mountaintop site. Dining Room Photo's of a bygone era Hearthstone Dining Room On the first floor, the dining room opens from the music room to the north. The dining room features cased beams, molded door, and window surrounds, paneled doors, and vertical wainscoting, all in pine. The room is lighted by a large triple window in the south elevation. It has a Georgian fireplace of green glazed brick, with a central panel with dentils and modillions. Music Room Music Room To the east of the entry, hall is the music room, which has molded door and window surrounds and peach-colored marble Neo-Classical fireplace with cable molding, a central carved scallop, and denticulated mantelpiece carried on consoles Library The Library, Central to the Hearthstone Design To the west of the dining room is the library, with oak door and window surrounds and a red brick fireplace with a denticulated mantel with a diamond motif. Grand Staircase c1960 Beautiful Details A grand staircase ascends from the entry hall to the second story. It is paneled in oak and edged with bead and reel molding. Its first landing is lighted by a large triple window set in the curving wall of the west tower. In the upper panes of the window are stained glass panels that depict the Sanford coat of arms. 2nd Floor Library Castle Library The second library in the castle is located on the second floor which contains a fireplace with oak surround, an entire wall of built-in bookshelves and pocket doors leading out to the landing and the five-second floor bedrooms. 2nd Floor Bedroom c1950 One of several bedrooms in the Castle 2nd Floor Bedroom c1960 Beautiful Bedroom with period furniture with french doors looking onto the property Living Room c1960 Living Room off the Dining Room circa 1960 Living Room c1960 The Living Room circa 1960 Butlers Pantry\/Kitchen c1960 Hearthstones Butlers Pantry and Kitchen circa 1960 Front Entry Fireplace Waiting area for visitors Dining Room c1985 Seen later in the 1960s Architectural Significance The castle incorporates elements from diverse periods in castle architecture. Its rectangular shape and D-ended towers strongly resemble the early Norman “great tower” castles of Chepstow and Colchester, both of which date from the late eleventh century. The use of corbelled bartizans was common to Scottish castles of the twelfth century. The arched openings of the porte-cochere and the windows appear primitive in part because of their construction, but they also vary in shape from distinctly pointed to distinctly round. The fenestration as a whole represents a compromise between authenticity and modernity. A few narrow medieval-style window slits are irregularly placed diagonally across the west elevation, but large Chicago-medieval-style triple windows prevail, and a bull’s eyeglass window is even featured in one of the slits. The interior also represents a compromise between the medieval theme and the nineteenth century. A medieval feeling is carried out fully in the entry hall and grand staircase, but the fireplace and paneled wall treatment are essentially Elizabethan . The rooms receive individual treatments which reach to a Georgian feeling in the dining room, and a restrained Classicism in the music room. Here is the state of Hearthstone Castle today, as of May 2017, it’s future is uncertain. Close CONTACT US",

Photo by Shelly Liebler It is the site of the May 24, 1864 land-naval “Action at Wilson’s Wharf,” the first major clash between U.S. Colored Troops (USCT) of Major General Benjamin F. Butler’s Army of the James and General Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia. The earthworks were built and manned by USCTs under the command of Brigadier General Edward A. Wild. Construction was not yet complete when Major General Fitzhugh Lee’s Confederate Cavalry attacked on May 24, 1864. After the “Action” the fortifications were completed and named Fort Pocahontas. Subsequent to its abandonment in June, 1865, the site remained virtually untouched before being purchased by Harrison Ruffin Tyler, grandson of 10th US President John Tyler, in 1996. Due to his vision, dedication, and generous support, efforts to preserve and interpret the fort continue today through Fort Pocahontas LTD, a private foundation of the Tyler family. Photo by Sandy Goss Guided tours for groups of 10 or more are available by appointment. The fort opens to the public for a reenactment each June.

Over the course of the project, Kronenberger & Sons Restoration expertly corrected structural deficiencies in the house by adding new beams and Lally columns in the cellar as well as reinforcing the summer beam and installing a new support post in Nathaniel’s Kitchen. Their team also installed new support posts in the second-floor bedchamber and added new headers and collar ties in the rafters in Adam’s Garret. Last week, our wonderful collections team carefully reinstalled collection pieces in each room, including Nathaniel’s Kitchen and Chamber pictured above. DeStefano & Chamberlain , Preservation Connecticut , the CT State Historic Preservation Office , Crosskey Architects , and Kronenberger & Sons Restoration played crucial roles in guiding this project to completion. Funding for this work was possible through the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development. All aspects of the project were carefully planned in compliance with the Connecticut State Historic Preservation Office and United States Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation. We are grateful to everyone who contributed to this project to help us preserve such an important historic landmark in New London. We’re able to keep history standing strong because of you! We hope you will join us on 10\/25 for Hempsted Halloween . This family-friendly event is free, and first-floor tours of the Joshua Hempsted House will be available!

Page-Vawter House in the town of Ansted in Fayette County, West Virginia was built in 1889-90 by company carpenters of the Gauley Mountain Coal Company for the family of William Nelson Page, who was company president. The palatial Victorian mansion is located on a knoll in the middle of town. William and Emma (née Gilham) Page raised their four children there, attended by a staff of 8 servants. Architect William Minter designed the house in a Gothic style. It has 15 regular rooms, plus a butler’s pantry and a dressing room. There are 11 fireplaces with hand-carved wooden mantels; most are in different styles. Even the doors have ornately decorated hinges.[2] The exterior features 52 8-foot-tall windows[3] According to author and railroad historian H. Reid in his book The Virginian Railway (Kalmbach, 1961), it was in this mansion that Page developed the plans for the coal-hauling Virginian Railway, which was financed by industrialist Henry Huddleston Rogers and became the “Richest Little Railroad in the World” after its completion in 1909. The nearby railroad town of Page was named for him. The mansion was later occupied by several generations of the Vawter family. In the 21st century, it still stands as evidence of the once-thriving coal business. It underwent a ground up restoration in 2007. The Page-Vawter House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. The house was purchased in 2007 by Jim and Debbie Campbell. The Campbell’s lovingly restored the house to it’s original glory, using the Gauley Mountain blueprints. In 2021, Dana Pauley and William Harmon bought the house with aspirations of running their own inn. The Pauley-Harmons fell in love with the gorgeous home, and look forward to sharing the rich history with guests.

Facebook Contact Main: (304) 238-1300 Deborah Jones , Site Manager West Virginia Independence Hall 1528 Market Street Wheeling, WV 26003 Birthplace of West Virginia Governor Pierpont used this building as his office during the time of the “Restored Government of Virginia.” It was at his east window that he composed the telegram to President Lincoln urging him to sign the bill for West Virginia statehood. In December 1862, President Lincoln received the statehood bill for the creation of new West Virginia and on December 31, President Lincoln signed the bill and West Virginia achieved statehood on June 20, 1863. Contrary to popular belief, Independence Hall was never the capitol of West Virginia. It was the capitol of the “Restored Government of Virginia” from 1861-1863. When WV became a state in 1863, the new Governor, Arthur Boreman, had his office in the building, but since the legislature was housed in what is now the Medical Arts Building on Eoff Street, that building is considered the state capitol for the period 1863-1869, when it then moved to Charleston. The US government recognized the existence of the “Restored Government of Virginia” at the second Wheeling convention in 1861. The executive branch recognized the restored government when President Lincoln granted Governor Pierpont’s request for more troops. The legislative branch recognized the restored gov’t when the House of Representatives seated John Carlile, William Brown and Killian Whaley as congressman from the Restored Government. In 1861, the general assembly of the “Restored Gov’t of Virginia” elected Waitman Wiley and John Carlile as US Senators from Virginia. The U.S. Senate made this election legitimate when it replaced Senators Hunter and Mason with Wiley and Carlile. Legislators not convinced of the constitutionality of the Restored Gov’t of Virginia” argued the legitimacy of seating Willey and Carlile. Delegates at the convention, however, felt that the state government in Richmond no longer existed due to succession, which left state positions vacant and that the people had the right to change a corrupt government. Recognition by President Lincoln and the federal government laid the groundwork for the legitimacy of the Restored Gov’t of Virginia and the western counties future bid for separation to form a new state. Faced with what the western citizens considered an overbearing and neglectful state government, citizens in the mountainous western regions of Virginia refused to take part in secession, –“the crowning of infamy”, thundered one politician from the west. West Virginia Independence Hall is the site of the first West Virginia Constitutional Convention and the first and second Wheeling Convention. Wheeling is the only city to serve as the capitol of two states and West Virginia is the only state formed from the Civil War … a state born of conviction, a state born advocating for and defending the United States of America rather than the seceded states of America. Western Virginians were very committed to the Union in a state that left the Union, and Wheeling was the center of this rebellion. Historical Architecture The hand cut sandstone building opened in 1859 at a cost of $96,000 as the Wheeling Custom House, post office and federal court. It incorporated the city’s first convection system for “central heat” and flushing toilets. The facilities of the Custom House played a major role in the statehood movement by providing Federal military protection, a facility for heated political discussions and a space for meetings of the constitutional conventions. The building housed offices for the loyalists’ government for the “Restored Government of Virginia”, under the leadership of Governor Francis Pierpont. After President Abraham Lincoln’s assurance that the new West Virginia not only wanted his protection in their rebellion, but also strongly supported his stand against slavery, Lincoln signed the proclamation making West Virginia the 35th state on June 20, 1863. In May 1964, the building was purchased by the State and West Virginia Independence Hall Foundation. By carefully following the architect’s original plans still on file in the National Archives, restoration began to restore West Virginia Independence Hall back to its original structure of massive 13-foot wooden doors, 12-foot windows, 20-foot ceilings and original and reproduction decorative ironwork. The National Park Service placed West Virginia Independence Hall on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. In addition, the birthplace of West Virginia gained national recognition as a National Historic Landmark in 1988. West Virginia Independence Hall is listed as a Heritage Site by the American Battlefield Trust. The Trust recognizes more than three-hundred sites in sixteen states that inspire and teach the story of the Civil War and its haunting impact on America. The American Battlefield Trust sites allow visitors to explore battlefields, historic homes, railroad stations, cemeteries, parks and other destinations that bring history to life. For more information on the American Battlefield Trust, visit them at battlefields.org . Current Exhibitions Currently, West Virginia Independence Hall has many exciting exhibits including 14 original Civil War battle flags, the original post office, Governor Pierpont’s and surveyor Hornbrook’s office and of course, our beautiful, restored court room. To see more of West Virginia Independence Hall’s exhibits, check out the Department of Arts, Culture and History’s photo gallery . West Virginia Independence Hall hosts many lectures, school tours, programs, public forums, bus tours, meetings, and state agencies throughout the year. The West Virginia I ndependence Hall foundation sponsors Civil War programs including movies and re-enactments of various kinds. Today, there are many programs, events, meetings and causes in the works at West Virginia Independence Hall. One of our past efforts, completed in May 2019, included raising money to relocate the largest Civil War monument in the state to the side yard of West Virginia Independence Hall, the grand Soldiers and Sailors monument, dedicated in 1883 to the men who fought and died in the Civil War. Soldiers and Sailors monument The museum is open Tuesday thru Saturday and admission is free.

The Legion was instrumental in creating the Veterans Administration in 1930 and an ardent supporter of its rise to Cabinet status when it became the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in 1989. Veterans Affairs The nation's cultural, moral and patriotic values have been under attack for decades, a disheartening trend that continues today. Americanism To those who have sworn with their lives to protect America against enemies near and far, national security is a deeply held value.

Tips to Avoid PACT Act Scams pdf_line Tips to Avoid PACT Act Scams Scammers are taking advantage of new opportunities to commit fraud. There's been an increase in PACT Act-related phishing (email) vishing (phone), and social media scams targeting Veterans to access their PACT Act benefits or submit claims on their behalf. Veterans should be cautious of anyone who guarantees a lucrative financial benefit or service. Useful Information About VA Benefits\/Beneficiaries Covered by the PACT Act (Public Law 117-168) The bipartisan legislation—Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022—is named in honor of an Army National Guard veteran. After deploying to Kosovo and Iraq as a combat medic with the Ohio National Guard, Robinson was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disorder and stage 4 lung cancer. He died in May 2020. His widow, Danielle, and their young daughter, Brielle, stood next to the president when he signed the bill into law. The legislation was spearheaded by Sens. Jon Tester, D-Mont., and Jerry Moran, R-Kan., and championed by The American Legion. The legislation will impact generations of veterans by expanding Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits and care for veterans exposed to burn pits and other toxic substances. The PACT Act is the most significant expansion of VA health-care benefits and services in more than 30 years and could impact as many as five million veterans. pdf_line What you need to know about the PACT Act pdf_line PACT Act Summary and FAQ's pdf_line VA PACT Act Survivor Benefits Military and Retirees with ID Cards that Don't Expire Will Need to Replace Them Within 2 Years Retirees and military family members who have identification cards with no expiration date can choose to upgrade to the new Next Generation Uniform Services Identification, or USID, cards whenever it’s convenient—as long as it’s done within the next four years, according to the Defense Department. There is no looming deadline for use of those old non-active-duty cards without expiration dates, but the department expects to completely phase out and replace them with the next-generation IDs, which are more durable and have enhanced security features, by 2026 , Maj. Charlie Dietz, a spokesman, told Military.com. In the meantime, cards with expiration dates are required to be replaced within 90 days of elapsing. The Defense Department began the effort to update all those IDs to the new format in July 2020, but the changeover was delayed due to the pandemic. “DoD plans to phase out and cancel the existing card forms in 2026 when all existing cards with an actual expiration date will have expired,” Dietz wrote in an email. “After then, only the USID card will be accepted for installation and benefits access.” The USID format for military retirees and dependents represents the first change to those identification cards in nearly 30 years; the last update was in 1993. The new design closely resembles the Common Access Card, or CAC, format issued to active-duty troops and department civilians. But there was uncertainty among those with cards that list the expiration as indefinite. The IDs are needed to access military facilities and to confirm eligibility for various military benefits , so missing a deadline or losing the identification could disrupt cardholders’ lives. Expired cards can be confiscated at base gates. Those with cards with no expiration dates “may have the card replaced at their convenience,” according to Dietz. The department recommends they go to the ID Card Office Online and use the office locator to find a site that issues the new cards and book an appointment. Retirees and their dependents, dependents of active-duty troops, reserve members, and Medal of Honor recipients are among those who will receive the USID cards. A description of the new cards and a complete list of who is eligible can be found here .

We are committed to mentoring and sponsorship of youth programs in our communities, advocating patriotism and honor, as well as promoting strong national security and continued devotion to our fellow service members and veterans. In contrast to other veterans’ organizations, the Legion offers a number of local programs and activities to strengthen its commitment to our nation’s grassroots and the people we serve. American Legion Baseball is one of the nation’s most successful amateur athletic programs; it continues to educate youths on the importance of sportsmanship and develops the quality of our country’s citizenship.

Legionnaires’ sense of obligation to their community, state, and nation drives an honest advocacy for veterans in Washington. The Legion stands not behind politics, but behind the issues and people that institute progress by focusing on veterans’ rights and quality of life.

    "homepage_content":"West Virginia State Farm Museum We are open April 1 st through November 15 th , Tuesday through Saturday and during special events. Buildings of historical value have been moved and rebuilt on the grounds. You will find log cabins and an early farmhouse, an operational 19th century blacksmith shop, turn-of-the-century doctor's and newspaper offices, the first Lutheran Church west of the Allegheny Mountains, and more. A work in progress, the Museum attractions change from year-to-year. The collection of artifacts continues and building restoration is ongoing. No visit would be complete without a stop to our country store, which features food products, crafts, and collectibles. Blacksmith Shop Carpenter Shop One-Room School House Wildlife Museum Museum Collection Log Cabins Summers House Nature Trail Log Church The Register Office Morgan Museum Country Doctor's Office Calendar of Events Plan a Visit Museum Map Staff & Board of Directors Make a Difference Volunteer Contact Us Tractor Pull Blacksmith Shop An fully operational Blacksmith Shop has been re-constructed on the farm museum grounds. While the fire in the forge is not always kept burning, we are fortunate on occasions to have skilled blacksmiths demonstrate their trade. The blacksmith shop contains hundreds of tools including the collection of tongs seen behind the re-enactor. One such person recently made the museum a beautiful tripod kettle stand. Carpenter Shop The Carpenter shop was donated by John E. Greene of Milton, Lafe Chapin of Huntington and Judge Russell Dunbar of Morgantown. It was moved intact from Milton by the Mason County Commission. The shop displays a large collection of antique carpentry tools. Some of these unique tools include a spring pole wood lathe, a shaving horse, a large wooden punch, two timber morticing drills, 200 year old wooden vices, an all wood morticing machine, and a variety of hand tools ( saws, levels, planes, hand augers, axes, etc.). One-Room School House The \"Mission Ridge One-Room School\" It was originally located about two miles northeast of the Farm Museum grounds on a ridge known as Mission Ridge, hence the name. It was built about 1870. Soon after West Virginia became a state, which was on June 20th, 1863, the state legislature passed a bill making it mandatory for the various counties of the state to finance the construction and operation of schools. Before becoming a state, while this area was still part of Virginia, the Virginia legislature had passed a bill giving various counties permission to levy for the operation and construction of free schools. However, very few counties or districts in West Virginia took advantage of this particular legislation. So, after West Virginia became a state, the legislature passed a bill making it mandatory for counties to operate free schools. Soon, school buildings began to be built throughout the state. The one-room school was an important institution in the rural communities of West Virginia for a number of years. One-room schools were quite common in all counties of West Virginia until a few years after World War II. At that time, many of the counties began a consolidation program. Roads were improved so that school buses could travel in all kinds of weather. Thus, many of the one-room schools were closed, and the students were brought to a central school. The one-room school had one teacher who was responsible for grades one through eight. These one-room schools usually had from 20 to 40 children. A school day was 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., with a morning and an afternoon recess of 15 minutes each and an hour period for lunch. In those days, there were no TV's or radios to watch or listen to, so older boys and girls often came to school even though they had graduated from the eighth grade. Christopher H. Bauer Memorial Wildlife Museum The museum is dedicated to Christopher H. Bauer, a native of Mason County, Point Pleasant High graduate, local businessman (barber shop), and avid outdoorsman. This building and Chris's collections are his legacy for all to enjoy. The museum contains a large collection of mounted and prominently displayed hunting trophies in the main hall. Another display room contains an extensive collection of firearms, knives and other hunting accessories. Museum Collection The Green Building This is a view of the Greene building which houses the main artifact collection. Thousands of artifacts are on display showing a way of farm life in this area by our ancestors for over a hundred years. This large metal building, 60' X 120' X 14' high, was the first building to be erected in the Farm Museum Complex. It was sponsored by the Mason County Commission, and was dedicated May 14, 1976. A large collection of antique farm machinery and farm related implements are displayed in this building. Log Cabins The second building added to the farm museum was a beautiful log cabin donated by Mr. & Mrs. William A. Barker of Southside, WV. The cabin is a fine example of the pioneer homes built during the early 1800's. The Allen Log Cabin is a two-story log house built around 1830 by Mr. John Allen and his son William. It was originally located near Procter, WV. It was last occupied in the late 1970's. The cabin was donated by Mr. & Mrs. Lane C. Evans. After being properly marked and disassembled on its original site in Procter, WV, it was transported to the West Virginia State Farm Museum and reassembled in the late 1980's, using the markers previously made. Considerable effort was expended to have the structure retain, as much as possible, its original materials and appearance. The structure was completed in 1994. One of the few changes made to the original design was the addition of handicapped accessible ramps. The museum had previously obtained, through donations, two huge handlooms and a large spinning wheel dating from the first half of the I9th century. These rare and historically important pieces are presently housed in the log house. The Allen Cabin houses some of the museums collection of early textile tools. The large spinning wheel is known as a Walking Wheel or Great Wheel. It was used to spin cotton or wool fibers. The yarn skeiner next to the wheel was used to measure the spun thread or yarn. A restored barn frame loom, complete with 300 hand tied string heddles has the beginnings of a wool rag rug. The skarn above the fireplace would have been used to hold the warp yarn for warping the loom. Also one each of the Museums old quilting frame and treadle sewing machine. The wooden furniture on the front porch was handmade by Roy Balser. Mr. & Mrs. Balser donated it to the Farm Museum in memory of their son James William Balser. George Summers House Historically, the Summers family was prominent in West Virginia politics. George Summers had an illustrious public career. He was elected to the Virginia Legislature in 1830 and to Congress in 1841. Family tradition states that Lincoln asked him to be his running mate when he ran for his second term as President. Because of his wife's illness, George Summers declined. The Summers Log house, part of a farmstead along the Kanawha River near Winfield, West Virginia, is a multi-part structure with architectural evidence indicating a construction date during the first quarter of the 19th century. The physical evidence is consistent with oral history, which gives the building's date as 1812. The house was moved to the Farm Museum from its original site on a farm known as Walnut Grove near Winfield in Putnam County. The farm was first secured by the family of Judge George William Summers, a prominent Kanawha County resident who was widely known in Virginia, West Virginia and national political arenas. Not only was he the first prosecuting attorney of Putnam County, he was also a member of the General Assembly of Virginia and also served two terms in the House of Representatives in the United States Congress. He was a strong pro-Union man. Of interest here is the fact that President Lincoln asked Judge Summers to be his running mate when Lincoln ran for president for a second term. According to family tradition, Summers rejected the offer due to his wife's (Amacetta Laidley Summers) illness. According to Walden Roush, who with his wife Louise, was the guiding genius in the establishment of the Farm Museum, the Summers house was moved to the Museum on November 23, 1980. Appalachian Power Company, in the process of building the John Amos Power plant, had purchased the farm property of Walnut Grove. Fred Summers was reputed to be the last family member to occupy the house. It had become the property of his niece, Miss Lucy Quarrier. Through the generosity and interest of Miss Quarrier, the Summers log house was offered to the Museum. Well known in the Art world, Lucy is said to have been one of the founders of the Arts and Crafts Fair at Cedar Lakes near Ripley. The Log House is a multi-part structure that utilizes two important types of construction in the form of log and plank modules, both of which require expert workmanship. In the original construction, logs were used in the section on the right side of the main entrance while planks were used in the left section. Roush explained that these planks had deteriorated. So it was necessary to use logs also in the left section during the restoration. Planks, however, were used in the back section off the kitchen and dining room. A large entrance hallway between the two sections included a stairway to the second floor of the one-and-a-half story house. However, the stairway faces the rear of the house so that it would not take up so much room. Two windows are on each front section with three gable-roofed dormer windows extending from the slope of the roof. Roush stated that it was problematic during the restoration to find weather boarding to match the original. He credited Leon Thompson of the Carolina Lumber Company for finding this material for the Museum. Fireplaces were built in all the rooms, including the upstairs bedrooms. The original mantels were moved with the structure. Numerous interesting articles of furniture may be seen throughout the house. In the left front room stands an ancient baby crib, mounted on rockers and having a high framework for a canopy used to cover the crib. It was donated to the Museum by John Musgrave. Also in this room are two other articles of interest. One is what appears to be a High Board but in reality contains a folding bed. Standing in this room is an easel supporting a Shadow Box. This glassed-in box contains a flat surface on which a colorful arrangement of handmade flowers are placed. Another item that will attract attention is in the kitchen adjoining this room. It is an ancient Home Comfort kitchen range. It was donated by John Scott of Athens, WV. There is another unusual item near the doorway, but we will leave it to the tour guide to explain that one. The Log House was to have been moved to Charleston, WV, where a full city block had been set aside for it. It was felt that the house would possibly be credited by the National Register of Historic places. This did not develop, and the Farm Museum is the richer for it. Nature Trail This trail accesses a parcel of land which was a TNT plant during World War II. This is the home of the legendary Mothman (if you believe in that sort of thing) Main Feature of the Trail: While most facilities used for manufacturing TNT at this site have been demolished, several interesting concrete structures remain. The structures are now partially obscured by vegetation and serve as a living example of how nature can reclaim itself in only a half-century. Trail Condition: Open Avenue of Trees: About 25 half-century old native trees are identified along the trail What is TNT? 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene is a yellow, odorless solid that does not occur naturally in the environment. It is commonly known as TNT and is an explosive used in military shells, bombs, and grenades, in industrial uses, and in underwater blasting. 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene production in the United States occurs solely at military arsenals. Impact on Point Pleasant: During the years of operation of WVOW, Point Pleasant was a boom-town. Chemists, scientists, engineers, electricians, plumbers, masons, heavy construction crews, and laborers representing nearly every building trade were required for the rapid buildup. Workers from all over the country converged on this area and construction continued around the clock. Residents claim the streets of downtown Point Pleasant were packed with people like the streets of New York City. Ordinance School was hurriedly constructed for the surge of children of construction workers and staff personnel and was the first ever elementary school built by the federal government. New housing additions were built in Point Pleasant for plant workers. Housing was constructed near the plant for military staff who oversaw and guarded the facility. Local men working at the plant were exempted from military service. History of the WVOW: The official name of the site was West Virginia Ordnance Works or WVOW. It was referred to by locals as the TNT Plant because it produced explosives during World War II. The facility was constructed on approximately 5,800 acres, with more than 2,000 acres used as a safety zone. The site selected for the plant had rail and water access via the nearby Ohio River. The facility consisted of 10 TNT manufacturing lines, two acid producing areas (North and South), acid loading areas on the Ohio River, a sellite (sodium sulfite) plant, toluene storage, two coal-fired power plants, pumping stations, 100 storage magazines, wastewater holding ponds, burning grounds, an administrative area, and employee housing. Closing the TNT Plant: On August 6, 1945, the first atomic bomb was dropped on the city of Hiroshima, Japan. Less than a month later on September 2, 1945, Japan surrendered. As soon as workers learned the war was over, production of TNT ceased and plant shutdown was initiated. Local residents recall that TNT plant workers left the area in droves and the exodus of the Point Pleasant area occurred more rapidly than the buildup. Due to changes to the landscape and deposits of harmful chemicals, the land was rendered unsuitable for farming. As a result of extensive cleanup and environmental testing efforts, selected parcels of the area have returned to private use, a game refuge and the Farm Museum. Points of Interest: South Acids Area: View interesting structures from the nature trail. These sturdy acid cradles were not demolished because of their sheer size and strength. Here you see evidence of how nature reclaims itself in our hot and humid climate in just a half century. Sellite Manufacturing Area: (Inside fenced area) During WVOW operations, sellite (sodium sulfite) was manufactured through the combination of soda ash and sulfur. A box factory and storage building were also located on the site. Following the suspension of the TNT manufacturing at WVOW, the site was used by the Mason Furniture Company for the manufacture of furniture from 1948 to the mid-1970s. The property was then leased by the West Virginia Mulch Company for the manufacture of mulch. Buildings now are used as museum storage and the land is used for demonstration farming Geology: The trail is on one of the main historic meanders of the Ohio River The soil is a mixture of various layers of granularities of sand and clay. This is an historic educational exhibit. Log Church This is a replica of the old Zion Lutheran Church which was originally located about two miles south of New Haven, WV in the community of Broad Run. It was the first Lutheran Church west of the Allegheny mountains, and it was one of the older churches in the area. A group of Lutherans from the Shenandoah valley moved into the community around 1800. They were German Lutherans whose forefathers had come directly from Germany. These families included the Roushes, the Weavers and others. The Zion Lutheran Congregation was organized in 1806 and for a while they met in private homes. In 1815 Daniel Roush donated a tract of land and the congregation built the old log church. Other congregations were also organized at the old church. In 1832 immigrants of the Presbyterian Faith came to Point Pleasant and used the old log church and in 1834 a congregation of United Brethren moved into the community and used the church. The old log church was used from about 1815 to 1895. Due to the deteriorated state of the original logs the church had to be rebuilt from architect's drawings and old pictures. Indian raids were always a threat during the early 1800s and the original church was built with a balcony and no windows and only one door for protection. In order to accommodate tour groups an extra door and windows were added to the rebuilt church at the farm museum. The old log church is still used for services during festivals and special events. Newspaper Office The Register Office The Point Pleasant Register, then a weekly paper, was housed in a small framed building, when editor George W. Trippett began printing the paper on March 6, 1882. He published the paper for more than 40 years. The masthead, listing Trippett as the editor and proprietor, indicated that the Daily Register was started in 1895. When plans developed for constructing a replica of this newspaper building in the middle 1970's, Oral Eads completed a set of plans for the museum that duplicated the 20-foot by 32-foot structure. All material for the Register Office, which is 20' X 32', were purchased by The Point Pleasant Register. The Good Sam Travel Club, headed by Nelson Ring, who served as supervisor, contributed greatly to this project. Some of the type and fonts came from L.W. Getty's business. The Register donated a Linotype Machine that is on display in the building as well as some composing tables that held drawers of different size type. The Linotype Machine was one of three that were located on the third floor of the Register building, situated at the time on Fifth Street in Point Pleasant. In the newspaper office you can see various types of printing presses. During festivals some of the presses will be in operation stamping out bulletins one at a time. Here a re-enactor operates one of the printing presses during Living History Days. Morgan Museum Mr. Sidney Morgan of Winfield, WV started the museum in 1905. The first bird he mounted was a loon, and it is still housed in the museum. It is in the north end of the building, mounted on a green slab. Everything in the Morgan Museum is very old. The work in the museum covers an extensive period of time. The first bird was mounted in 1905, and the others were added as time went on. The information we got from some of Mr. Morgan's relatives was that Mr. Sidney Morgan was to go with Teddy Roosevelt (as his taxidermist) on a safari to Africa. For some reason or other (which has been lost to posterity), he did not get to go, and, of course, he was very disappointed. While talking to his brother, Mr. Morgan decided that they should go on their own safari, so they built a small sternwheel paddleboat called the Shirley. During Mr. Morgan's lifetime he made five trips all the way to the Gulf of Mexico, collecting birds and animals along the rivers. He also made trips up and down several other rivers, including the Arkansas and the Missouri. He financed his trips by taking along sportsmen from the Charleston area who paid him for the trip. Mr. Morgan was an artist when it came to mounting animals and birds. He made every effort to pose his animals and birds naturally. A good example of his creativity in taxidermy is the red fox located on the top shelf display at the museum. This fox had apparently killed a grouse; so Mr. Morgan not only mounted the grouse, but he also put feathers in the mouth of the fox to make it appear more realistic. Just over from this display is another fox that had killed a duck. This fox is mounted as if running away with the duck slung over its back. As the story goes, Mr. Morgan killed the fox as it was running away from a pond. He then copied its natural pose. You will see many other examples of his creativity as you look around the museum. For example, there is a raccoon that is mounted on an old hollow tree. Mr. Morgan's step-grandson was with him the night that the raccoon was killed. The tree was cut down, and the slab was added to the exhibit. The big elk in the back was the last elk killed in West Virginia. Mr. Morgan killed it at Minnehaha Springs, Pocahontas County and mounted it in 1912. The biggest bird in the museum is the Golden Eagle and the smallest is the little hummingbird. There is also a two-headed calf, which was born in 1926 on one of the farms near Mr. Morgan's museum. It lived for a number of weeks. But, as the story goes, it got out of the barn one cold winter night and froze to death. The farmer found it the next morning just outside the barn. He then gave it to Mr. Morgan to be mounted. There is also a display of some unusual steel traps. The large trap is hand-made. The other is a Newcome trap, which is said to be one of the largest bear traps ever made. The box traps that are on display were used to trap live game, such as rabbits, opossums, etc. Years ago, most boys had a box trap or two. They would use them to catch rabbits for food. Mr. John E. Greene and his associates of Milton, WV donated the Morgan Museum to the Farm Museum. The Mason County Commission paid the sum of nine thousand dollars to move the four buildings to the Farm Museum complex. Volunteers helped with the moving and were responsible for putting the porches back onto the buildings and for leveling them on their foundations. The Museum was started in 1905 just above Winfield on land that is now occupied by the John Amos Power Plant. Mr. Morgan's father owned approximately 1500 acres of choice bottom land where the John Amos Plant is now located. When Morgan's father died, the land was left to Sidney and to his mother, Mrs. Morgan. Sidney Morgan had no interest in farming. His main interests were hunting and taxidermy. Whenever Mrs. Morgan or Sid needed money, they would sell off some of their 1500-acre farm. When the John Amos Power Plant moved in (in 1963) and took over quite a few acres in that area, Mr. Morgan only had four acres left of the original 1500. The power plant took over the land on which the museum was situated, and the museum was sold at auction. Mr. John E. Greene of Milton, WV bought the Morgan Museum and moved it to Milton near the Blinko Glass Plant. He added three other buildings to the complex, a Country Store, a Country Kitchen and a Blacksmith Shop. After operating these for two or three years as a tourist attraction, Mr. Greene decided to give the four buildings to the Farm Museum. The propeller on display is from the Airship Shenandoah. The Shenandoah crashed near Ava, Ohio, in 1925, taking the lives of 14 members of its crew. Country Doctor's Office Dr. Milton J. Lilly, Sr. was a native of Mercer County in West Virginia and a 1904 graduate of Maryland Medical College in Baltimore. His first practice was as a company doctor for the Pocahontas Coal Company in McDowell County, WV. Not long after marrying a young school teacher from Roanoke, VA, Dr. Lilly, his wife and infant daughter moved to Upland in Mason County to take over the practice of Dr. James Rowsey. Dr. Lilly established his practice and home in Mason County raising seven children and living there until his death in 1967.

Staff & Board of Directors Staff Tim Kidwell, Executive Director Jackie Lyons, Office Manager Aden Warden, Maintenance and Grounds Board of Directors Larry Jones, President John Ohlinger, Vice President Michelle Hart, Secretary Dennis Brumfield, Treasurer John Goroncy, Executive Committee Ralph Kelvington, Executive Committee Lorri Stalnaker, Executive Committee Josh Russell, Board of Directors Joe Kincaid, Board of Directors Bryan Smith, Board of Directors Nancy Smith, Board of Directors Make a Difference Most of the items in the Museum collection were donated by our generous friends. The Museum is a not-for-profit organization. There may be certain tax advantages for you to donate to the Museum and you should first consult a tax professional. There are many ways to donate to the Museum. You can donate money. You can donate artifacts. And you can donate your time. All of these are important to us and we would not have a Museum without them all. You may make a donation to a specific project. If you see a need for a certain display, facility, service, etc., and you would like to usher it into being, please discuss your idea with the staff. For example, our military exhibit is the result of the work of a single individual who constructed the viewing area, obtained and arranged the artifacts, and maintains the display. Funds The State Farm Museum, like most museums, always lack sufficient funding. While we do receive financial support from state and county sources for maintenance costs, we rely on private donations and grants from institutions for improvements to our grounds and facilities. Money can be donated as an outright gift. If you would like to donate as part of a will, please consult your attorney to make proper arrangements. If you see a need for a certain display, facility, service, etc., and you would like to usher it into being, please discuss your idea with the Museum staff. Our military display is the result of the vision of a single person (a retired military man) who constructed the display area, obtained and arranged the artifacts, and maintains the display. Artifacts If you have an artifact that you think would be appropriate in the Museum collection, it is advisable to contact someone on the museum staff to discuss the item. (This may save you the trouble of transporting the item.) If the Museum staff agrees that the item is in keeping with the mission of the Museum, either your can transport the item to the Museum, or their personnel can pick up the item. The Museum has equipment necessary to move most items. When you donate an item to the Museum, you will be asked to sign an agreement that you relinquish ownership of the artifact to the Museum. Due to display space limitations, your object may not be immediately displayed. It may be placed in a safe storage area and used in future displays as displays are rotated periodically to increase interest and encourage return visits. Some artifacts may be maintained in the condition they were received. However, some items such as tractors and farm equipment may be restored and put to use on the Museum grounds. The appearance or utility of a donated item may thus be altered. While the museum does not anticipate it when they accept an item, there is a possibility that the item you donated to Museum may disappear. Not everything is under lock and key. Sometimes an item will get moved to another location and the books are not updated and we simply can't find it. We try very hard to safeguard our artifacts. Museum staff members are very much aware of the emotion attached to objects donated to the Museum and respect for your feelings is always a consideration. The Museum simply cannot be a warehouse for every artifact in the state and we are sometimes forced to make choices because of limitations of storage and display area, and the costs of maintaining artifacts in our humid climate. You can rest assured that any item placed into the custody of the Museum will have a lasting benefit to the Museum and community. Time You can donate your time. President George W. Bush has recommended that every American volunteer 2000 hours of their time to any worthwhile project of their own choosing. The persons developing this web site are volunteers. The Farm Museum always needs volunteers. The greatest need for volunteers is to help conduct school tours. On some days there are several hundred school children visiting the Museum! Volunteers are needed in the kitchen, blacksmith and carpentry shop, store, and loom room. A group of dedicated volunteers meet every Thursday evening to restore maintain the antique tractors. Volunteers are needed to help maintain the grounds and buildings. It does not matter what your skill levels may be, there is always something that most people can do, and your efforts, what ever they may be, will be appreciated by the community.

The Farm Museum always needs volunteers. The greatest need for volunteers is to help conduct school tours. On some days there are several hundred school children visiting the Museum! Volunteers are needed in the Country Kitchen to prepare our delicious home cooked meals at festival time. We feature fresh baked pies and home-made ice cream. Volunteers who can work with their hands are needed in the blacksmith and carpentry shop. We have a very complete blacksmith shop with forge and a pile of coal waiting for you. Our carpentry shop, however, has no power tools. A group of dedicated volunteers meets every Thursday evening to restore and maintain the antique tractors. This group is legendary. If you would like to learn about antique tractor restoration, this is the place to do it. We are in progress of building a new paint booth so we can apply better automotive finishes to restored equipment. Volunteers are needed to help maintain the grounds. We have a lot of lawn area and many trees, shrubs, annuals, perennials, and a herb garden. Our gardens grow weeds just like any other garden. Volunteers are needed to help maintain or many buildings. Some of our structures have stood for over 100 years and it is a job maintaining them so they will be here for the next century. There are log cabins, board-and-batten, and clapboard siding which need constant repair and upkeep. Help is sometimes required to dismantle an old barn or building, transport it to the Museum and reassemble it. Think of the friends you could make by doing that! During our festivals, volunteers run the antique tractors and steam engines, operate the sawmill, sorghum mill, apple press, blacksmith and carpenter shop, prepare meals in the kitchen, and explain displays to our visiting friends. It doesn't matter what your skill levels may be, there is always something around the Museum that most people can do, and your efforts, what ever they may be, will be appreciated by the community. There are projects for young and old, male or female; there are even things you can do with your horse or oxen. We even have a spiffy new riding lawn mower that we can have you trained to operate in very little time! If you would like to talk to someone about volunteering, e-mail us , or call (304) 675-5737.

I've done many, but this one is top notch. Professional and safe, yet challenging and exciting. You won't fine a commercial cave tour it's equal. Far better than Mammoth cave, this is the one to do. Great guides, family-run, all equipment included, as well as snacks on the trip, home-cooked lunch afterwards, and even emailed pics from the trip all included. If you're up for some adventure (and don't mind getting a little dirty in the dark) then this is the tour for you. – Len B, Yelp Fun and interesting! This is one of the few caves in the United States that you can tour without a guide. Stroll through at your own pace. Take a camera. I took a number of great photos. If you are interested in rocks, minerals, and fossils, the gift shop has drawer- fulls of nice specimens. There is a picnic area outside with tables, as well. The cave is easy to find and only three or four minutes from the interstate. – Doug C, TripAdvisor Perfect day trip! My boys (9 & 6) have been twice and have enjoyed it both times. The self-guided tour is pretty cool. We made a day of it by visiting downtown Lewisburg and then doing the cave. Even at a slow pace, we were done in under an hour. The little shop is nice and the owners\/staff are very nice. Bring a long sleeved shirt it is in the 50's in the cave. – Sarah W, TripAdvisor Amazing & Magical Tour After stopping at this cavern we had the delight of our life. We received instructions about the cavern, handed a flashlight, (just in case), and began our descent. Signs everywhere gave you the basics of cave creation, with large and\/or beautiful designs created by nature. Ten minutes later, brief flashes became complete darkness. Within minutes, the manager came to tell us that the power was out and, if we'd like, we could leave and offered us a refund, but we could continue exploring as long as we'd like (until closing). We stayed and explored. I recommend doing this more often; Explore in the dark. How exciting! – Cat D, TripAdvisor Love this Place We loved this place! Prices were reasonable too! We did a self-guided tour and the girl at the desk was very friendly and helpful! The caverns were very nice with descriptions by the formations, my kids did the rock mining, and we shopped in the gift shop. We would definitely go back if ever in this area. – Dawnelle K, Yelp Incredible My boyfriend and I did the wild cave tour with Steve and it was INCREDIBLE. Steve was an amazing guide and paid great attention to our individual needs, our safety, provided great conversation and made the trip well worth it. The caving itself was a blast.

House Tour Examine the lives and experiences of the first two owners of the Phelps-Hatheway House, Shem Burbank and Oliver Phelps. Although the two lived during the same period, they experienced the 18th century in different ways. How did their political views and the opportunities they pursued during the American Revolution change their fortunes—or lack thereof? Understand the role of Connecticut in the American Revolution, examine colonial era trade and commercial exchange, consider land and real estate speculation and Indigenous Peoples’ land rights, and observe the ways we display wealth and status.

Holiday Lantern Tour: Suffield’s Main Street December 7 @ 4:00 pm – 5:00 pm LEARN MORE The Phelps-Hatheway House & Garden highlights the luxurious lifestyle enjoyed by two wealthy 18th-century Connecticut Valley families until their fortunes collapsed. Suffield native Shem Burbank built the center chimney structure in 1761 where he and his wife Anna Fitch Burbank raised nine children. Due to the unstable national economy during and after the American Revolution, the family’s financial situation suffered. In 1788, he sold the house to Oliver Phelps originally of Windsor, who served as Deputy Commissary under George Washington. In 1794, Phelps commissioned the addition of a substantial wing decorated with imported Parisian wallpaper. The contrasts between the two sections of the house further highlight the differences between Burbank’s and Phelps’ personalities, experiences, and times. Later, Phelps tried to sell significant swaths of land that belonged to members of the Seneca Nation as part of Connecticut’s Western Reserve. When a precarious market made him lose his property in 1802, he moved to Canandaigua, NY, where he died in 1809. The Hatheway family took possession of the house from the early 1800s to 1914, accumulating an attic full of artifacts that document life from that time. Sumner Fuller and his mother Emma carefully preserved the property which was donated to the Antiquarian & Landmarks Society (now CTL) upon Mrs. Fuller’s death in 1956. Today, the museum boasts an extensive collection of 18th-century antiques while the grounds feature a Colonial Revival Garden installed by landscape architect Mary Wells Edwards in 1964, a large herb bed, and scattered flowering shrubs, all lovingly maintained by the Suffield Garden Club. Réveillon Wallpaper Project The Phelps-Hatheway House is home to incredible 18th-century wallpaper that tells the history of Connecticut during the American Revolution and the lifestyle of its inhabitant, Oliver Phelps, through its intricate designs. Explore the wallpaper’s story and learn how you can be a part of the important conservation project currently underway. With the expertise of Studio TKM Associates, this project will inform Connecticut Landmarks and other organizations of the best ways to care for these rare wallpapers, so they remain a resource for visitors.

    "homepage_content":"The Wagon Box Fight, 1867 | WyoHistory.org Skip to main content The Wagon Box Fight, 1867 Kerry Drake Saturday, November 8, 2014 Sioux and Cheyenne warriors who gathered west of Fort Phil Kearny on the morning of Aug. 2, 1867, had several reasons to feel confident as they prepared to attack civilian woodcutters and the U.S. Army troops assigned to protect them. Nine months earlier, Lakota, Cheyenne and Arapaho warriors had attacked troops along the Bozeman Trail about four miles north of the fort, which is located near present-day Story, Wyo, on the east flank of the Bighorn Mountains halfway between the present towns of Buffalo and Sheridan. Tribal leaders sent out a small band of decoys that managed to lure Capt. William J. Fetterman into an area where he and all 80 of his men were ambushed and killed. At the time, it was the worst military defeat ever suffered by the Army on the Great Plains. On Aug. 2, 1867, Oglala Sioux warriors attacked troops and civilian woodcutters replenishing Fort Phil Kearny's wood supply several miles northwest of the fort. Wikipedia. Red Cloud’s War In the summer of 1867, looking to repeat their success, Indians—furious that white men the year before had built three forts along the new Bozeman Trail across their land in the Powder River Basin—planned attacks on two of the forts. The federal government contended the forts and defense of the trail were necessary because the route offered the quickest path to gold mine discoveries in Montana. The conflict became known as Red Cloud’s War. Oglala Sioux Chief Red Cloud led the tribe's resistance to the U.S. Army's incursion into the Powder River Basin in the 1860s. Whether he was at the Wagon Box Fight is unclear. First People. Sioux Chief Red Cloud had vowed to kill every white man found on the Indians' land. The Indians harassed troops and white travelers more or less continually. The next large attacks after the Fetterman massacre came in August. One contingent of warriors battled soldiers and civilians at the Hayfield Fight on Aug. 1, 1867, near Fort C.F. Smith on the Bighorn River in southern Montana Territory. Early the next morning, Red Cloud and more than 1,000 warriors gathered and attacked woodcutters and soldiers near a spot about six miles northwest of Fort Phil Kearny. What happened over the course of six hours on August 2 became known as the Wagon Box Fight, a relatively small battle that became well known for several disparate reasons. It was the Army’s first chance to claim victory after the Fetterman disaster, though in retrospect the fight seems more like a draw. At the time and since, there were widely conflicting reports on the number of Indian casualties, and for this reason too the fight continues to draw the interest of students of the Indian Wars. Finally, the fight is important in the history of tactics because it was the first time a large force of mounted tribesmen faced sustained fire from relatively rapid-shooting, breech-loading rifles. The warriors’ old tactics of closing fast on horseback for close combat with their enemies no longer worked—and they paid a heavy price. The wood supply Hundreds of infantry and cavalry soldiers based at Fort Phil Kearny needed a steady supply of wood from forests on the slopes of the Bighorn Mountains for construction at the fort, as well as a constant supply for fuel for cooking and for the next winter's heating. Protecting the contracted civilian woodcutters was thus one of the Army’s most important jobs if the troops were to survive in hostile country. The wood line where the prairie met the mountain forest was about six miles from the fort. Wagon trains of woodcutters and their soldier guards suffered constant small attacks during the entire two years Fort Phil Kearny was in existence. View toward the Bighorn Mountains and the site of the Wagon Box Fight, from the reconstructed stockade of Fort Phil Kearny. Vasily Vlasov, Panoramio. On August 2, the tribes tried something much larger. The Indians held a distinct advantage because their foes had split into two groups. Civilian woodcutters decided to stay at a camp near the wood line, about a mile from a makeshift stock corral the soldiers had fashioned from14 wagon boxes, removed from their running gear and set on the ground. Logs were transported from the woodcutting camp to the fort resting directly on the running gear. A wagon-box corral The wagon boxes were 10 feet long, two and a half feet high and four and a half feet wide. The wood was only about an inch thick, with no lining. The boxes eventually served as the main line of defense against a massed Indian force determined to overrun the corral and the 32 men using it as cover. Capt. James W. Powell was in command of C Company, 26th Infantry, which at the end of July had relieved the company previously guarding the woodcutters, and so his troops were new to the job. He set up operations at the corral. Early on August 2, Powell sent 13 men out from the corral to guard the woodcutters' camp and another 14 to escort wagons carrying wood to and from the fort. That left the captain and Lt. John C. Jenness at the corral with 26 enlisted men. The soldiers at the corral were joined by two civilian teamsters who had left the fort that morning to hunt deer. The pair saw Indian smoke signals and tried to get back to the fort, but wound up at the corral instead. The first attack The Indians set their sights on the camp's mule herd, with 200 warriors on foot trying to scatter the animals, but the mule herders kept the attackers at bay until a new wave of Indians managed to drive off the herd and set fire to the woodcutters’ camp. Simultaneously, about 500 Indians attacked the woodcutters. Then the woodcutters and their soldier guards tried to move toward the fort, bypassing the corral. Three soldiers and four civilian contractors were killed, but Powell managed to divert the Indians' attention by mounting an attack on the rear of the Indian force from the corral, which allowed the rest of the woodcutting camp's occupants to hide in the timber or get to the fort. Within 15 minutes, an estimated 800 Indians on horseback surrounded Powell and his men at the makeshift corral. Using field glasses to scan the area, Lt. Jenness reportedly told the men he spotted Red Cloud at the top of a hill with other Indian leaders. It has never been verified that Red Cloud was at the scene, and because the lieutenant didn't know what the man looked like, Jenness may have misidentified another chief. Trapdoor Springfields Unlike Fetterman's troops, who carried muzzle-loaders that could only fire three rounds a minute at most, the men at the wagon boxes were equipped with new breech-loading Springfield trapdoor rifles. Seven hundred of these weapons were brought to the fort a short time before by wood contractor J.R. Porter of the Gilmore & Proctor firm. They could fire 15 to 20 rounds per minute. Unfortunately, there hadn't been any time for target shooting, and Army weapons training was known to be dubious at best. Still, most of the men managed to at least become familiar with the new rifles in the weeks since the weapons had arrived. New, breech-loading Springfield Model 1866 The soldiers punched two-inch holes into the wooden wagon boxes so they could fire through them. Yokes, bags of grain, kegs and other equipment were stacked between wagons for protection. Some men fired over the tops of the boxes, and blankets covered the tops to hide the men's positions and provide limited protection from the arrows raining down on them. The Indians were primarily armed with bows and arrows, lances and war clubs, though some had firearms captured months earlier during the Fetterman attack. They didn't have much ammunition, however. The soldiers at the Wagon Box Fight began the battle with 7,000 rounds on hand—and this large supply saved their lives. Once the attack began, most of Powell's men kept their ammunition in their hats. Although this was convenient, it left their heads exposed to the sun and its sweltering heat. In addition, the troops had to deal with the stench: Indians coated their arrows with burning pitch that set fire to hay and mule and horse dung. The soldiers’ superior firepower drove back the initial wave of Indians and they retreated to about 600 yards from the corral and spent the next few hours making separate attacks on foot. A long fight Powell was at one end of the corral, with Jenness stationed at the other. Participants later reported that a few Indians managed to get within 5 feet of the corral, but none penetrated the barrier. Jenness was shot in the head and killed, as were two privates, Henry Haggerty and Thomas Boyle. Two other privates were wounded in the fight. A teamster, R.J. Smyth, later recalled the lieutenant's bravery during the battle. “Lt. Jenness had just cautioned me not to expose my person, and to hold my fire until I was sure of getting an Indian at each shot,” Smyth said. “He had moved a few feet from my box when he was shot through the head, I think he died instantly. He was a grand, good man, and a fearless officer. I told him to keep under cover. He stated he was compelled to expose himself in order to look after his men.” Several soldiers wrote firsthand accounts of the ordeal. Sgt. Samuel S. Gibson, who at 18 was the youngest soldier at the corral, recorded the most detailed and dramatic version of the event. He had been dispatched to guard duty at the woodcutters' camp and had a skirmish with several Indians before he and another soldier made it safely to the corral. “The whole plain was alive with Indians shooting at us, and the tops of the boxes were ripped and literally torn to slivers by their bullets,” he wrote. “How we ever escaped with such slight loss I have never been able to understand, but we made every shot tell in return, and soon the whole plain in front of us was strewn with dead and dying Indians and ponies. It was a horrible sight!” Gibson added, “The Indians were amazed at the rapidity and continuity of our fire. They did not know we had been equipped with breech-loaders and supposed that after firing the first shot they could ride us down before we could reload.” The monument at the site of the Wagon Box Fight was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1936. Wikipedia. Sometime between noon and 1 p.m., hundreds of warriors led by Red Cloud's nephew charged the corral on horseback, hurtling toward the wagons in a V-shaped wedge. Powell later recalled that things looked very bleak at that moment, especially because ammunition was running low and his men were exhausted from holding off the Indians for so long. After Indians on horseback were initially forced to retreat from the corral area, they tried to attack on foot over the next three hours. On Sullivant's Ridge, a hill to the east, were several hundred Indians out of range who had been watching the battle “like spectators,” but it appeared to Powell that they would enter the fray. A howitzer rescue Just at that moment, though, Powell said he heard the sound of a howitzer shell hit and saw a rescue party led by Maj. Benjamin F. Smith, who had 100 men with him. “The shell fired was in the direction of the Indians [on the hill], but fell short, as I anticipated,” Smith noted in his report, “but [it] seemed to disconcert them as a number of mounted Indians who were riding rapidly toward my command turned and fled.” The Indians who had been attacking the corral as well as the ones watching the action all retreated. Smith, arriving at the corral, was shocked to find that most of the men had survived the intense encounter. He had expected them all to be dead. “It was a hard lot to look at. The day was hot and the sun was beating down on them in the wagon beds,” he wrote. “The smoke from their guns had colored their faces and they looked as though they had used burnt cork on their faces.” Each survivor received a big drink of whiskey from a keg brought along on the rescue mission by the post surgeon, Dr. Samuel M. Horton. Indian casualties Text on the 1936 monument overstates the number of Indian warriors and casualties. Vasily Vlasov, Panoramio. Estimates of Indian casualties in the Wagon Box Fight, though, vary enormously; they range from two dead to 1,500. To date no one has come up with a definitive answer about why there is no agreement on the numbers. “No [other] event has had more wild, inaccurate tales written concerning it,” writer Vie Willits Garber noted in a 1964 Annals of Wyoming article. Two respected historians–Stanley Vestal and George Hyde–as well as several Sioux leaders said only six warriors were killed and six more wounded. But there are accounts of people who later talked about the battle with Red Cloud. They said the chief told them that the count was much higher. Gen. Grenville M. Dodge interviewed Red Cloud in 1885, and he told him more than 1,100 Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapahos were killed or wounded at the fight. A Sioux medicine man, whose name was not recorded, visited the post of Col. Richard I. Dodge at North Platte in the fall of 1867. He told the colonel that the total of dead and injured was 1,137, and that figure was widely reported the same year as the battle. Hyde’s book, Red Cloud's Folk was published in 1937, based on interviews Hyde had conducted decades earlier. Hyde said that late in his life Red Cloud, who died in 1909, claimed not to remember the Wagon Box Fight at all. The historian said that was unlikely, given the large number of warriors in the battle and the fact that it marked the chief's last major fight. In his official report, Powell estimated 60 Indians killed and 120 wounded–figures held up to ridicule by some historians as “wildly exaggerated,” while his Army superiors believed he was being incredibly modest about the body count. Enlisted men at the scene supported much larger claims, with various shooters putting the number of dead between 300 and 800. The account of at least one Indian warrior, an Oglala Sioux named Fire Thunder, supports the claim of heavy Indian losses. He described “dead warriors and horses piled all around the [wagon] boxes and scattered over the plain.” In 1969, at a reenactment of the Wagon Box Fight near Sheridan, Wyo., some Indian descendants of the participants claimed Indian casualties were between 1,200 and 1,500. Hyde said while he knew of no written accounts of the battle by Indians, they did not regard the fight as a defeat. If the reports of six dead and six wounded Indians were accurate, as Hyde believed them to be, he said they inflicted more damage to the white men at the camp and the corral because they killed a total of six soldiers and four civilians, plus capturing a large number of horses and mules. Aftermath In the Treaty of Fort Laramie in 1868, with the transcontinental railroad nearing completion and opening up a new, shorter route to the Montana gold fields, the government agreed to abandon the forts on the Bozeman Trail, to make the western half of Dakota Territory a large reservation for the Sioux and to allow the tribes to hunt buffalo in the Powder River Basin of what are now Wyoming and Montana. The tribes burned the abandoned forts shortly after the Army left. The Wagon Box Fight was the last major battle of Red Cloud's war against the white men he felt had invaded the land they had promised to his people. Some historians credit the battle with teaching both sides valuable tactical lessons. To the Army, it was now clear that Red Cloud commanded thousands of hostile warriors, not just a small number of malcontents. The tribes, meanwhile, became convinced that they did not have a chance against large numbers of troops unless they could secure similar firepower, which they did by the time of the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876.

Explore a world-class collection of historic military vehicles and artifacts, honor the service and sacrifice of our veterans and their families, and honor the history of American freedom. Honoring Our Veterans, Supporting Their Lives 𝗩𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗻’𝘀 𝗗𝗮𝘆 𝗠𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗮𝗴𝗲 – 𝗦𝘂𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗱𝗲. 𝗘𝗻𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵 𝗶𝘀 𝗲𝗻𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵. We just lost another combat veteran friend to suicide. He was loved. He was supported. He had children. He had a lot to live for. He also was in pain. He had to have felt anguish and hopelessness. Now he is gone. It did not have to happen, but it did. We have to do better stopping veteran suicide. I am neither a mental health professional nor a veteran, but I have lost family members and friends to suicide and considered suicide myself seriously enough to have planned it in detail. Here is what I see as some common threads. Anyone can commit suicide. There is no stereotype. People who commit suicide often give no advance clue to those around them. They assure family and friends they are fine. Reasons for suicide are diverse. They might include consequences of TBI and\/or PTSD. There may be other changes in brain chemistry. Hopelessness. Lack of purpose. Isolation. Failure to meet one’s own expectations. Shame. Survivor’s guilt. Veterans often check these boxes at a higher rate than non-veterans. Veterans served and sacrificed years of their lives to protect the rest of us. It is now our turn to return the favor. I do not have all the answers on how to do this, but I do have some ideas: 𝟭. 𝗘𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗴𝗺𝗮 𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘀𝘂𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗱𝗲 𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻. In my view, it is common, normal, and part of the human condition, not a flaw or a sign of weakness. I disclosed my own suicide ideation to set an example. Let’s talk about suicide like we would talk about any other part of being human. Let’s dispel this part of a veteran’s isolation or shame and get the visibility to intervene at exactly the right time. 𝟮. 𝗘𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗼𝘆 𝘃𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀. This can help provide purpose, connection, and self-esteem. 𝟯. 𝗙𝗮𝗰𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗼𝗻𝗲-𝗼𝗻-𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗽𝘀. Be creative. We can all help veterans and their families be better connected. 𝟰. 𝗦𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗪𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗛𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 We recently founded a 501(c)(3) nonprofit to help veterans and their families through outdoor wilderness experiences provided free of charge. This includes hunting, camping, equine therapy, horseback riding, side-by-side trips, hiking, mountain scenery and peacefulness, and staring into a camp fire with other veterans. Consider donating at wildernesshealingproject.org to help us reach more veterans. 100% of all donations go directly to funding veteran services. The National Museum of Military Vehicles pays all administrative and overhead expenses. 𝟱. 𝗦𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁 𝗼𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗺𝘀 𝗵𝗲𝗹𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗿𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗲 𝘃𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗻 𝘀𝘂𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗱𝗲. There are many private programs that could use more visibility and participation, such as the Veterans Talking to Veterans Program created by Mentor Agility (mentoragility.com) and supported by the Wyoming Military Department (wyomilitary.wyo.gov) and Catholic Charities of Wyoming (charitieswyoming.org).

In that post, I asked people to weigh in with ideas on what we can do to stop or reduce veteran suicides. A friend who is a Navy Corpsman combat veteran and Associate Dean of Men at Hillsdale College responded with great wisdom and gave me permission to re-post his letter. Below is his letter in its entirety. Please spread the word and keep the ideas coming: Dan, I read your piece on Veteran Suicide, and it truly saddened me to hear about your friend. I too have lost friends, co-workers, and fellow Sailors and Marines to suicide. Like you, I’ve thought long and hard about what can be done to confront this epidemic. I agree completely that this conversation needs to happen more often—and not behind closed doors. It should be a kitchen table topic, something we can speak about openly and honestly. Intergenerational Mentorship • Pairing veterans with at-risk youth, college RAs, or even ROTC students gives vets a chance to lead again. • Passing on discipline and resilience reframes their experience as valuable — not tragic. • This restores purpose and the “protector” role in a new context. Spiritual and Moral Reconciliation • Many veterans carry unseen spiritual wounds — guilt, betrayal, or loss of faith. • Chaplain-led retreats or veteran-specific confession spaces can provide real healing. • These programs focus not on diagnosis, but on forgiveness, meaning, and belonging — often the missing pieces in suicide prevention. Veteran-Led Economic Cooperatives • Giving veterans ownership in small businesses or co-ops creates long-term stability and pride. • Example: A veteran-owned carpentry shop or auto garage where profits and leadership rotate among members. • It meets three needs at once: employment, community, and dignity. Training Civilians to Listen Differently • The burden shouldn’t fall only on vets — communities often don’t know how to engage them. • Teaching civilians to “listen without fixing” or to invite veterans into meaningful roles can be life-saving. • Churches, campuses, and employers can host “Veteran Story Nights” or “Mission Debriefs” that allow honest conversations to happen naturally. (Almost like a “train the trainer,” as we would say in the military.) Restoring Tribe • The loss of tribe after service is one of the most dangerous shifts. • Rebuilding that tribe — through mission trips, leadership development, or service projects with civilians — can recreate the sense of belonging that prevents despair. All of these ideas take time, but I believe it’s in the small things — in the simple moments, in the “little” — that much can be found. Sometimes healing begins not with a program, but with presence, a shared meal, or a listening ear. That’s what we do with student veterans here at Hillsdale. Very Respectfully, Jeffery Rogers Associate Dean of Men Hillsdale College If you or someone you know is struggling or thinking about suicide, help is available right now. You’re not alone — please call or text 988, or chat via 988lifeline.org to connect with support 24\/7. NMMV and Wyoming Department of Education: Unveiling a New Educational Partnership State Superintendent Megan Degenfelder and the University of Wyoming Malcolm Wallop Program Launch Military History Curriculum with the National Museum of Military Vehicles DUBOIS – State Superintendent Megan Degenfelder and the Wyoming Department of Education (WDE) joined Dan Starks, founder of the National Museum of Military Vehicles (NMMV), to celebrate the launch of a vibrant series of curricula based around WWII, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. The project is a collaboration between the WDE, the NMMV, the University of Wyoming Malcolm Wallop Civic Engagement Program, and four Wyoming teachers. The Daniels Fund also supported the initiative with a grant. “This passion project has been in the making for over a year as part of our initiative to increase patriotism in schools,” said Degenfelder. “As we move toward America’s Semi-Quincentennial, we are excited to share this important content with Wyoming students, further instilling patriotism in future generations.” The curriculum videos were created by the museum production staff with input from several teachers across the state and in partnership with resources from the Wallop Program. Materials are hosted in the WDE’s Civics Ed Center , providing free access to all Wyoming teachers, homeschool families, and other organizations. “The short videos, summaries, lesson plans, and links to exercises and additional resources will help Wyoming teachers make these conflicts come to life for their students. They also do an excellent job demonstrating the central role that the United States has played in shaping the world over the last 80 years and the sacrifices our veterans have made to make our freedoms possible,” said Jean Garrison, Stewart Family Professor of Public Service and Director of the Wallop Civic Engagement Program. Wyoming teachers involved in the project include: Kate Decker (Greybull Middle School), Allen Doty (Meeteetse School), Bryce Middelstadt (Kelly Walsh High School), and Aaron Makelky (Kelly Walsh High School), defining the lesson plans. Teacher participation was supported through funding from the Daniels Fund. “It is so important that students can witness history and connect it to people they know or to their own experiences. Not only does the museum bring these things to life for our students, but it provides so many opportunities for educators to help their kids connect to our service members and our country,” said Decker. “I was captivated by the experience of working with the National Museum of Military Vehicles in Dubois. We are fortunate to have such a rich historical resource in our state, and I am grateful for the time I was able to spend exploring, learning, and asking questions. Hopefully my World War II Technology lesson will captivate students and get them interested in learning more about our nation’s history and the amazing museum in our home state,” said Makelky. To support the project, lesson plans have been developed and are available for you to access here. Watch a recording of the media event in Dubois. On Veterans Day 2024, Dan Starks announced the museum’s partnership with the Wyoming Department of Education to develop curriculum and materials for the state’s teachers.

A World-Class Museum The National Museum of Military Vehicles in Dubois, Wyoming, is a premier destination for learning about and honoring the history of American freedom. The Museum showcases how freedom has been accomplished and maintained through the service and sacrifice of our military service members, veterans, and their families. Our museum is home to the world’s largest private collection of U.S. military ground transportation vehicles on display to the public. Just under 350 of the collection’s more than 500 vehicles are routinely on exhibit. The galleries and displays will immerse you in pivotal moments of our nation’s military history. Through the exhibits, you will better understand the sacrifices our service members and their families have had to make to preserve liberty and freedom at home and abroad. The Mission of National Museum of Military Vehicles is: To honor the service and sacrifice of our veterans and their families. To educate the public on the history of American freedom. To preserve and share historic military vehicles. An Unforgettable Discovery in the Wyoming Wilderness What began as a spontaneous roadside stop turned into the highlight of Casey LaDelle’s road trip—and one of the most compelling museum visits he’s ever filmed. Tucked away in the quiet town of Dubois, Wyoming, the National Museum of Military Vehicles offers far more than a collection of restored tanks and trucks. It’s an immersive, world-class journey through American military history, complete with rare vehicles, original D-Day invasion plans, battlefield soundscapes, and hands-on exhibits that bring the past to life. Casey captures the awe and emotion of exploring this hidden gem in his first video, and we’re excited to share a glimpse of it with you here. Whether you’re a history buff, a veteran, or simply curious, this museum is a powerful reminder of the stories behind the steel—and it’s absolutely worth the trip. We welcomed Casey back for another visit, and he put together a terrific new video: “The Incredible Shop That Rebuilds History.” Click here to check it out! Visitor Testimonials “This was an incredible experience. You could spend hours here. It is so detailed and realistic.” Lisa Lund Google review “This was absolutely one of my favorite stops on our vacation. If you can make it a part of your trip, I 100% recommend visiting. The displays were amazing and very thought provoking.” Jenny Brown Google review “I visited this world-class museum yesterday. The facility and the presentations are mind boggling. I can’t think of enough superlatives to describe. It is a must see facility with a very scenic drive from the west.” Chris Heyer Facebook “Amazing place to visit! We took our grandsons, 15, 12 and 7. They couldn’t stop talking about all the things they’ve been wanting to see and actually got to see at the museum. So much more than just vehicles. ” Paul S. Tripadvisor Museum Videos",

Enjoy two peaceful evenings on the shores of high mountain lakes, home of the Loon and the Trumpeter Swan. The views on the Teton Wagon Train are incomparable as our guests completely encircle the Teton Mountain Range and trek in country nestled very close to Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park and two wilderness areas. In fact, you camp one night on the top of the Teton Mountain Range and trek continuously within the “Yellowstone Grizzly Bear Recovery Zone”. FOR RESERVATIONS OR INFORMATIONAL BROCHURES CALL US AT 307-734-6101 Camp Activities Couples, families, and individuals of all ages can enjoy this unique vacation experience full of adventure and outdoor educational opportunities. People from four to eighty-five years of age have experienced this covered wagon trek of a lifetime – and many return time and time again. It is not necessary to know how to ride a horse or have camping experience. Our ranch hands will be glad to give instructions! Once in camp, there is plenty of time to take nature hikes, swim, trail ride on horseback, learn to handle a rope, canoe, throw tomahawks and knives, explore the beautiful country or just relax. Evenings are spent singing with the cowboys around the campfire, listening to yarns about the Old West, enjoying the western views of the stars, and if you are lucky, the Northern Lights! Of course, no covered wagon train would be complete without a visit from a mountain man, as well as a few other surprises. On the last day of the trip, a Pony Express rider delivers mail to camp. As our guest, you will also be formally inducted into the Double H Bar Ranch Family and be given a “Cowboy Send Off” to be remembered forever. Enjoy a taste of the west as savory meals are prepared in Dutch Ovens over an open fire. Our Conestoga chuck wagon is always stocked and ready to roll. We aim to satisfy even the heartiest outdoor appetite with roast beef, barbecued chicken, mashed potatoes, vegetables, salads, fruit, etc. The food is excellent and there is plenty of it! Nothing can beat our outdoor cooking! When you wake up in the morning, the smell of coffee and bacon sizzling is a great enticement to get up and start another remarkable day.

Some of the hotels in Jackson allow you to store your extra luggage there. If not, we will store it for you. Where do I park my car while I am on the wagon train? Some of the hotels in Jackson allow you to park in their lots while on the trip. Ask the front desk. If not, we have a small lot that you can park in. Is there a weight limit to go on the wagon train or to ride horseback? No. How many hours a day do we travel? Generally, we will be on the road for 2-3 hours a day. The longest trip is broken up into 2 segments, each 2 hours long, with lunch in the middle. Can I bring my own horse? No. Our horses are used to the environment, the altitude and each other. We have limited space in which to keep the horses and cannot accommodate outside animals. Call Now Button",

Education Programs Explore Our Exhibits In our Old World exhibits you can experience daily life in farm households in the 1600s and 1700s in England, Ireland, Germany, and West Africa. Explore the Museum The Frontier Culture Museum is the biggest open-air living history museum in the Shenandoah Valley, as well as one of the highest rated family-friendly attractions and one of the top tourist destinations in Virginia. Costumed historical interpreters show the life and customs of the indigenous Native American tribes in Virginia, the arrival of the German, English and Irish settlers along the Great Wagon Road, and the painful journey of the enslaved Africans to the first permanent British colony in North America. Visitors may also interact with a blacksmith at an Irish Forge, woodworkers, tailors, and yarn spinners, and learn how the early settlers of America cooked and worked the land. I visited the museum with a school field trip and I’m so glad I was able to go. The staff was so smart, patient, and informative. Each area had some kind of hands-on experience for the kids (and adults) to participate. I think we’ll remember this experience for years to come and I hope I get a chance to go back with my family and spend more time at each exhibit! Friendly staff at each “Country” giving you a good representation of what daily life would be like for the average person a few hundred years ago. Most of the building was brought from each country here and reassembled, witch seems like a feat in itself. UPCOMING EVENTS Loading view.

Voted âBest Tourist Attraction and Historical Siteâ by True West Magazine. Old Trail Town is one of Cody, Wyomingâs most popular family friendly western destinations and is conveniently located just off US HWY 16-20-14 on your way to the East entrance of Yellowstone National Park. On this site in 1895, western scout and showman, William F. (“Buffalo Bill”) Cody, laid out the original town site of Cody, Wyoming, which was named in his honor. Old Trail Town is an outdoor museum. In order to preserve our buildings and grounds we do not allow pets, food, beverages, or smoking within the town. Â Today Old Trail Town preserves the lifestyle and history of the Frontier West through a rare collection of authentic structures and furnishings. From remote locations in Wyoming and Montana these historic buildings were carefully disassembled, moved and reassembled here at Old Trail Town by Western historian Bob Edgar and friends. Located here also are thousands of historic artifacts from the Old West and grave sites of several notable Western figures. Among them is the grave of mountain man John Johnston, who was portrayed by the actor Robert Redford in the 1972 motion picture “Jeremiah Johnson”. Here too are original cabins used by Old West outlaws Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and a Wyoming saloon frequented by Cassidy’s “Hole-in-the-Wall Gang”. Also on this site is the log cabin home of “Curley” a Crow Indian army scout who helped guide Lt Col. George A. Custer and the U.S. 7th Cavalry to the battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876. Old Trail Town exists today as a memorial to the uniquely American experience known throughout the world as “the Old West”. Curley was a Crow scout with the Custer Expedition. He lived in this cabin on the Crow Reservation in Montana from 1885 to 1923. He relayed news of Brevet Major General George Custer’s defeat at the Battle of the Little Big Horn on June 25, 1876. He was one of the Crow scouts who survived the battle. Read More... Bob Edgar, a native of the Wyoming Big Horn Basin, had developed an interest in archaeology and history at a young age. After exploring much of the region Bob realized that the old historical buildings and associated materials were rapidly disappearing from the landscape. Read More... TAKE A TRIP BACK TO THE WEST!

It was not until after the Sullivan expedition in 1779 that families were able to establish a permanent settlement in the Tunkhannock area. In 1842, Wyoming County was created from part of Luzerne County. The name \"Wyoming\" is derived from an Indian word meaning \"extensive meadows.\" With its glistening streams, gently rolling hills and tranquil valleys, Wyoming County is undoubtedly one of Pennsylvania's most scenic counties. With a history and heritage running as wide and deep as the Susquehanna River that crosses its pastoral fields and meadows, the Wyoming County Historical Society was organized to make this information available to the public.

Upcoming Events About Rye New Hampshire Rye is located on the Atlantic Ocean and its eight miles of coast line is the longest in NH. Three magnificent serpentine beaches created by rocky headlands have drawn people to the town for centuries. There are 850 acres of salt marsh and, with all the fresh water marsh, almost two thirds of the town’s 35.5 square miles is water. The four southern-most islands of the Isles of Shoals: Star, Lunging, White and Seavey, which are located six miles off the coast, are also part of Rye. There are several ponds, some lovely open fields, many acres of privately owned forest and a significant amount of public and conservation land gained through donation and conservation easements. The land of Rye was originally inhabited by native peoples for over 12,000 years.The first European settlement in 1623 at Odiorne Point was called Pannaway, later nicknamed Sandy Beach until 1726 when it became the parish of Rye and then gained independent town status in 1785. The town’s history is rich in farming, fishing and ocean side resort history. Rye’strategic location has put it in the nexus of change in American history by its proximity to Portsmouth, commerce in all directions and several international connections. The natural beauty of the town and the historical significance of its built environment continue to beckon people. The population in 2020 was 5,500. Over 200 residents volunteer to serve on town government boards. Nonprofit organizations such as the Rye Civic League and the Rye Historical Society provide strong community connections. Voters have consistently supported the preservation of open space, wetlands ecology and historic buildings. The Rye Historical Society was founded in 1976 and its museum opened in 2002. Through special exhibits and regular programs and museum hours, the society aims to engage people in the vital aspects of Rye's history so that current issues may be better understood and future plans respect the natural and human history of the town. record your memories The Rye Historical Society is interested in preserving the memories of people who have lived in Rye. As new exhibits are curated, we will post a link to a form to collect information to be part of a digital exhibit that ties in with the physical museum exhibit.

Like Stonehenge in England, America's Stonehenge was built by ancient people well versed in astronomy and stone construction. It has been determined that the site is an accurate astronomical calendar. It was, and still can be, used to determine specific solar and lunar events of the year.

The 1857 Report of the Selectmen of the Town of Warner referred to a bridge known as \"Waterloo Bridge\" which was repaired at a cost of $78.00. The 1860 report notes that $473.65 was paid by the town of Warner for building Waterloo Bridge. That is a little more than half the amount paid to construct the Lower Village Bridge in the same year which may suggest that it wasn’t a completely new bridge, but an older bridge that was significantly repaired. Or, possibly a new bridge constructed using materials from the former one. The bulk of this amount was paid to Dutton Woods for the actual building of the bridge with lesser amounts being paid to William Bean, William B. Davis, Eleazor Davis, and John Colby for related tasks. In 1913, windows were cut into the bridge so travelers could look for oncoming trains at the crossing just beyond its entrance. It was rebuilt a second time in 1970, at a cost of $16,300 under the state Town Bridge Aid Program. Finally, the bridge was rehabilitated by the state in 1987 at a cost of $3,000. The Waterloo Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 21, 1976. Sources: Marshall, Richard G..

Our campus consists of two barns, one main building, and the Reid-Burpee house adjacent to the Carriage Barn. The Carriage Barn is filled with tools, horse-drawn carriages, folk-style paintings of old Sugar Hill, and a Benjamin Morrill tower clock. The second barn, the Sleigh Shed, displays a vast and growing collection of historic public signs and sleighs, including one sleigh from the Bette Davis estate. It also garages the 1939 Ford fire Truck#2 given to the newly formed sugar Hill Fire Department in 1948 by Henry Crapo. This Ford truck, originally a farm truck, was retro-fitted by the firemen. When the museum is open, the fire truck magically appears on the front lawn. The main building contains extensive photograph archives, a local history and genealogy library, the John E. Bigelow Gallery, public room, a gift shop, and a unique main gallery exhibit which changes annually to reflect the history of sugar Hill’s people and places. Admission is free. Memberships and donations are encouraged. Special tours may be arranged during the season. Contact Curator-Director Kitty Bigelow at 603-823-5275.

History: The Sugar Hill Historical Museum began as a bicentennial project by a group of very enthusiastic residents who were concerned about creating a home for the history of Sugar Hill. The original building was a schoolhouse moved stick by stick from the neighboring town of Easton to the present spot by the newly formed Sugar Hill Fire Department. In 1948, radiant heat caused a fire in the school, and the building eventually became a four-stall firehouse. When the new fire department building opened in in 1975, the vacant building was renovated and reopened in 1976 as the Sugar Hill Historical Museum. Cultural Statement: Our purpose is to be an educational resource for the public through research, study, collection, preservation and exhibition of artifacts that illustrate the history of our community.

The Heritage Museum is Hillsborough's refurbished Fire House. Our displays include the original Hillsborough Grange Hall Theater Curtains and the MPM Photo Collection. A treasure trove of searchable historic images. The Manahan-Phelps-McCulloch Collection is a collection of more than 250,000 images from a photographic studio in continuous operation in Hillsborough from the early 1860's. The studio originally opened under the ownership of Solon Newman, and has changed ownership many times over the years. Starting in 1899, William H. Manahan Jr. ran the studio for 54 years until Cyrus Phelps took over in 1953. In 2002, Donald McCulloch and Catherine Phelps McCulloch, the final proprietors, donated the collection to the Hillsborough Historical Society. The society has been preserving and documenting the collection ever since. Museum volunteers would be happy to assist you in our research area during normal hours on Wednesday and Saturday.

Joan Reichardt is a teacher at Augusta High School, specializing in World War II history. She earned a Bachelors of Science in Education and a Masters of Arts in Teaching Social Studies from Emporia State. She began her teaching career in Augusta. This is her thirty-fourth year in education. Reichardt’s father was a WWII vet. He was in the Navy at the very end of the war and saw no action but he was at Bikini Atoll the summer of 1946 for Operation Crossroads, the test of two atomic bombs on naval vessels. She understands that the WWII generation was the greatest generation and their sacrifices should be held as an example for current and future generations. “WWII is the watershed event of modern history,” she says. “The lesson we should have learned from the events of WWII and the Holocaust must be taught and hopefully not ignored now or in the future.

The Town of Windham The town of Windham, located in northeastern Connecticut, is in the southwestern corner of Windham County along the Natchaug River. Incorporated in 1692, Windham originally included the current towns of Mansfield and Scotland , as well as parts of Chaplin and Hampton . It was not until 1857, when the last of these areas incorporated, that Windham took on its current shape. The town of Windham includes the city of Willimantic, which consolidated with Windham upon the dissolution of the city government in 1983. Named after Wyndam, England, the town’s early industry included numerous mills that brought Windham renown as a leader in thread manufacturing. --CTHistory.org Visit CTHistory.org What's New?

Please visit to enjoy the roarin' 20's and the flappers as well as WWI era uniforms. Hots, gloves and other beautiful accessories are on display. Admission is free. New Storm Windows This year we received a $10,000 matching grant from the 1772 Foundation to remove the old plexiglass from 1975 that was covering our windows with brand new glass storm windows. The old plexiglass was yellowed and scratched and did not allow us to look out our windows. It also made the beautiful building look run down. The transformation is amazing. Please take notice if you are driving by. Thanks to Pat Brady for his work.

Morrill State Historic Site was the home of Justin Smith Morrill, the longest-serving member of Congress in the first 160 years of its history. During his tenure in Congress, Morrill advocated for higher education and reinforced a knowledge-based democracy. The Senator was recognized for sponsoring landmark legislation that helped establish public universities (Land Grant Acts) and for framing of the Fourteenth Amendment that granted equal protection and rights to freed slaves. Justin Morrill was essentially self-taught, amassing an impressive personal library and studying architecture on his own. He was responsible for the design of his family home in Strafford, Vermont. Constructed in 1851 and enlarged seven years later, the house is an outstanding example of the Gothic Revival style of architecture popularized by Andrew Jackson Downing and Alexander Jackson Davis in the early 19 th century. Senator Morrill used their architectural handbooks to design his dream house, adapting the forms and details to suit his own vision. Morrill also planned the surrounding gardens, studying the romantic landscape movement with its formal yet picturesque plantings. He selected only those plants that would survive the wintry Vermont climate and annually monitored their success again the harsh elements. Today, the homestead that Justin Morrill created in Strafford included a horse barn, carriage barn, ice house, blacksmith shop, and summer gazebo (no longer standing), which reflected Morrill’s diversified interests in farming, as well as the needs of 19th century rural living. The buildings were tightly grouped in a neat row along a farm road that lead back to a manmade ice pond on the hill at the back of the property. The pond was the source for an extensive water system that fed the house, barns, and gardens and was a source for harvesting ice. Additions and alterations to the property in 1901 by James Morrill, Justin’s only child, included the shuffle board court, hot house (razed 2016), cow barn, sheep barn, and relocated\/joined the carriage barn and horse barn. In 1960, the property was recognized as a National Historic Landmark, the first such honorary designation in Vermont. The Senator Justin S. Morrill State Historic Site was created in 1969, when the property was conveyed to the State of Vermont by the Justin Smith Morrill Foundation, Inc. The 1851 house is dressed in furnishings from Morrill’s 1871 home that once stood at One Thomas Circle in Washington, D.C. In 2007, the horse barn relocated by James Morrill in 1901 was reconstructed in its original location to serve as an education center and library. Young historians, videographers, and photographers did remarkable work at the Justin Morrill State Historic Site during the 2020 Photo & Video Story Camp. The camp was sponsored by the Friends of the Morrill Homestead and managed by Lindsay and Scott McClure Miller of World Story Exchange.

The current collection contains artifacts from prehistory to the present. The exhibition floor follows a timeline of permanent and rotating exhibits that feature historical events, individuals, and achievements. Permanent exhibits feature Don Knotts, a vintage printing shop, local glassware, pottery, musicians, and more. Admission to the museum is free. Group tours are available upon request. The museum is located in the annex of a former Morgantown Post Office located at 175 Kirk Street. Completed in 1931, the annex was a necessary expansion to the post office building that was completed in 1914. The post office and annex served the community until the 1970s, when a new post office was built nearby. Both the former post office and annex were placed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 28, 1979.

    "homepage_content":"Thomas Griswold House top of page The Thomas Griswold House Museum (1764) 171 Boston Street Guilford June - September Saturday 11-4 & Sunday 12-4 Admission is Free. The Thomas Griswold House is a classic New England saltbox dwelling standing on a commanding knoll along a picturesque stretch of the old Post Road in Guilford-now designated as a state scenic road. Thomas Griswold III built the house for two of his sons, John and Ezra, circa 1764, on land that had been in the Griswold family since Thomas Griswold II moved from Wethersfield in 1695. John Griswold, Jr. sold his interest in the property to his cousin George, who also inherited his father Ezra's portion. The house remained in the possession of descendants of George and his wife, Nancy Landon, until purchased by the Guilford Keeping Society in 1958. The Guilford Keeping Society has carried out two major restoration projects, one in 1974 and one in 1995. The house is now furnished in the style of the early nineteenth century, representing the period of George and Nancy Griswold's occupancy. Several items mentioned in George Griswold's inventory are still in the house, including a parlor mirror and a dressing table. One upstairs room is dedicated to temporary exhibits of items from the Society's collection, primarily nineteenth century clothing and Guilford photographs.

Washington Auto Road climbs from Route 16 in Pinkham Notch in New Hampshire to the highest peak in the Northeast at 6288 feet.

Book Now TAKE IN THE BREATHTAKING VIEWS OF MT. WASHINGTON WELL worth the time, energy & money! We took the Auto Tour (a large van) & were so glad we did....lane widths are just adequate, and there are no guardrails. Smelled a lot of hot brakes! But oh my! What phenomenal views! The maples were aflame with color! And Mt Washington is way above the surrounding mountains, so you see peak after peak below you, as you look to the horizon, plus a few lakes. Just beautiful. Is we're ever here again, we may take the courage train up. – Mary C. | Tripadvisor Trip to the Rock Pile Mt. Washington is a long time favorite of ours. We enjoy going up, not matter how the method. This time we took the coach. Kevin was a great tour guide!! He was funny, polite and great to listen to. The clouds and fall colors were wonderful. Way to many people, but have to share right. We can't wait to go again – Jay C. | Tripadvisor Exceeded Expectations Had a truly awesome ride up the mountain yesterday in a 61-year old Morgan. The road is steep, bendy, and narrow but stay calm and in low gear and you'll do just fine. The weather yesterday was perfect and visibility fantastic in all directions. Because of that the road was busy and my biggest problem was big SUVs and trucks slowing down as I was going up to squeeze past each other. It is a narrow road but the views are incredible. Highly recommended--but do check the weather at the summit first. – Jonathan K. | Tripadvisor Excellent Definitely the way to go, don’t drive yourself, this is much more relaxing and you can see the scenery. Just the right amount of time. You also will get more from the informative guides also. It was overcast and foggy when we started but we went through the clouds and it was mostly sunny and actually warmer with no wind at the top, not what we were expecting. Unusual as our guide said. Definitely recommend. – Daniel O. | Tripadvisor Do not pass this up! Going to the top of Mount Washington was the highlight of our trip. It’s amazing to see the forest change as you gain elevation and it’s truly like another world at the top. We debated driving versus the guided tour. I’m very thankful we did this. The price is reasonable and the guide was great. More importantly it made me thankful I did not attempt to drive it myself. You will learn a lot from others mistakes and save your brakes. – Michelle D. | Tripadvisor Awesome, amazing! This was an amazing experience that I had to live. The views are espectacular. I’m not going to lie, going up there was a rush of adrenaline. I was scared but excited too. Kevin was our tour guide and he was so wonderful. Very kind, he was telling us all about the Mountains, trail tracks and everything. Loved this! – Marleny H. | Tripadvisor Link Gallery DONATE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE MT.

Visitors may continue to enjoy the park during the off season by parking outside the gate and walking in during these same hours. Please be aware that facilities are closed during the off season. For more than 275 years, a fort has stood to protect the approaches to the Piscataqua River at the southern gateway to Kittery, Maine. The most recent of these is Fort McClary, named for New Hampshire native Major Andrew McClary who died at the Revolutionary War's Battle of Bunker Hill. Fort McClary stands today as one of the state's most important historic forts that dramatically preserves evidence of military history and changes in military architecture and technology. The buildings presently on the site represent several different periods of construction as the fort was upgraded and modified to meet the area's defensive needs. The site was manned during five wars: The Revolutionary War, War of 1812, Civil War, Spanish-American War, and World War I. Like most other Maine forts, it saw little conflict.

The volunteers who greeted us were very friendly. And more than willing to answer questions. I recommend this place to anyone interested in military history. I’ve already decided this is one place I will be going back to. Stephanie Heinritz Spent a few hours at the Military Veterans Museum & Education Center this Memorial Day with Livi. We received an awesome tour with another family from Ron, and were even able to see a few of the trucks, jeeps etc being driven and parked by veterans and volunteers between parades. Carri Jones Someone recommended this museum while we would be in Oshkosh to visit the EAA museum. From the outside, it may not appear to be much, but WOW, were we surprised! Stu greeted us and gave us an overview of what was where in the museum, and then we were off to explore. There’s uniforms and artifacts from different eras, excellent videos, but the best is the giant garage with MANY military vehicles. There are quite a few you can get in to, sit in, pretend, etc. Very kid friendly. Uniforms they can wear while in the museum. Everyone was VERY friendly. When we went, it was only open Fri-Sun. Admission is free, but donations accepted. Don’t sleep on it – highly recommend! Debbie Krajnovich I thought it was great and very educational. I did not realize that there was going to be somebody explaining every exhibit on display which was kind of neat otherwise we would have just walked past the exhibits and not realized exactly anything about what went on at period of time. Brittany There was a lot more here than I thought. The staff are very knowledgeable and friendly. The amount of vehicles they have that you can see up close and personal and even the weapons was very impressive. Mandy Petri This is an amazing place to learn about all the wars. It’s so important to keep this knowledge alive. Ted was so incredibly informative and loved that our kids came along. He made us all feel very welcome",

History The buildings at Macktown Living History include the 1846 The Whitman's Store, the 1839 Stephen Mack residence, and the rebuilt Stevens shop, which housed the first schoolhouse in Winnebago County, plus the modern Macktown Living History Education Center. Macktown Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It contains remnants of both historic and prehistoric cultures, dating back thousands of years. Education Macktown Sundays are brought to you by Macktown Living History. These Sundays are a family-friendly way to present aspects of living on the site; both prehistoric and historic. Reenactors, guest presenters, and Macktown volunteers will present a variety of topics including aspects of archaeology, native culture, gardening, farming, and fiber arts, to name but a few. These Sundays will span the cultures from prehistoric times through 1850. Visitors will be able to participate in many of the activities. The goal of Macktown Sundays is to help the public understand the history of the area. Please add these dates to your calendar, watch for flyers, and check our website and Facebook page for updates. ​​​We look forward to exploring the past with you every month of the year. Summer and fall programs have been developed to provide educational experiences for college students, other adults, and teenagers under the supervision of professional archaeologists. Programs include excavation and recovering artifacts, artifact processing, identifying finds, and interpreting their significance Preservation Archaeological research at Macktown began with a systematic survey of 30 acres of the 50-acre town platted by Stephen Mack and James Bradstreet in 1836 at the confluence of the Rock and Pecatonica rivers. The initial survey showed that the entire 30 acres contained artifacts from Native American campsites, some dating to as far back as 8,000 years, and historic pioneer households from the Mack era, ending about 1851. Since that survey was completed extensive excavations have been conducted at a shellfish processing area along the Rock River and on the associated Native American campsites on the terraces above; these camps date primarily from the Middle and Late Woodland periods from 2,500 years ago to about 1,200 years ago. Many more Native American camps are yet to be explored. ​The majority of archaeological excavations have been conducted at locations of historic structures that are no longer visible on the ground surface. These include Hayes Tavern (a mid 19th-century bed and breakfast), the Stephen and Merrill Mack store, the Henry Bates house and shoemaker shop, the William Shores house, and blacksmith shop, and the two still standing Macktown era, the William Whitman House and Store and the Stephen Mack 1839 residence. These excavations have produced the remnants of houses, outbuildings, and thousands of both Native American and pioneer artifacts. Data from these projects provide information about the daily lives of the people who have lived in this resource-rich environment and contribute to the recreation of the area as a living history of mid-19th-century life in Macktown.

The word I’m sure the Wakelys said many times. They built their home along the beautiful, but wild, Wisconsin river. They traveled as far north, as they safely could by water, stopping where the river transitioned to rapids and waterfalls. Many travelers arrived, in hopes of finding work farther north at the logging camps or sawmills. The river was not the only access to the homestead, as the Pinery Road also goes through the property. Traveling by road was slow and difficult because of the muddy and sandy conditions. Pointe Basse became a bustling community, providing respite and supplies for the weary travelers. Our goal is education and entertainment for the community and to perpetuate the written history of Point Basse and its former inhabitants. We are open during scheduled events and classes throughout the year. Please see the Events Gallery , Schedule of Events , Classes , Videos , and Points of Interest if you are planning a visit. Members receive free entry into most of the events. There are many ways that you can help perpetuate the history of Point Basse: The site relies solely on volunteers for its’ operations, if you have an interest in a single event or would like to help out on a regular basis, we have a well-versed group of volunteers to welcome you.

Share Plan Your Visit Overview Ideas for Your Visit Admission & Hours Directions & Contact Info Facilities & Accessibility Venue Rental Property Map Regulations & Advisories Overview To visit the Old Manse—a handsome Georgian clapboard built on the banks of the Concord River in 1770—is to re-experience pivotal moments in our nation’s early history. Constructed for patriot minister William Emerson, the upstairs overlooks North Bridge, where the famous battle of April 19, 1775, took place. Later, some of New England’s most esteemed minds found inspiration inside its walls. In the 19th century, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Nathaniel Hawthorne both called the Manse home for a time: Emerson drafted his influential essay “Nature” in an upstairs study. Meanwhile, Hawthorne and his wife, Sophia, started their married life here; the recreated heirloom vegetable garden was originally planted by Henry David Thoreau in honor of the Hawthornes’ wedding.

We have targeted key historical, social and economic events that affected and influenced African Americans in Wisconsin. EVENTS Click here to view our events… GROUP TOUR The Wisconsin Black Historical Society\/ Museum welcome all group tours. Please see the attached tour request form. Donate to WI Black Historical Society Wisconsin Black Historical Society\/ Museum The Wisconsin Black Historical Society\/Museum located on the corners of North 27 and West Center Streets opened its door and its heart to the community, city, and state in 1987. Based on the premise that a people who know their history will grow to love and appreciate themselves more, the Society is striving to create a bright future out of a heart-breaking past. The mission of the Wisconsin Black Historical Society\/Museum is to document and preserve the historical heritage of African descent in Wisconsin. The Museum exhibits, collects and disseminates materials depicting this heritage. Serving as a resource center for all people interested in Wisconsin’s rich African American heritage, the Museum’s purpose is to encourage and promote family community and cultural activities. Our founding director, Clayborn Benson III produced the documentary called Black Communities. The three-part documentary (USA, Wisconsin and Milwaukee) and it was this film that inspired him to establish the Wisconsin Black Historical Society\/Museum in 1987. In producing the documentary Benson discovered that the records and documents concerning the history and roots of African American people in Wisconsin were widely scattered and poorly preserved. Benson felt the stories had to be told. In 1988 the Museum became an affiliated member of The State Historical Society. The museum’s home was constructed in 1898, was the Engine No. 2 Fire Station. It was converted into the Center Street Library in 1928 and has been our home since the library relocated in 1987. After 30 years in existence the WBHS\/M has developed programming and activities to directly educate the surrounding community. Some examples of these programs include tutoring for children K-12th grades, seasonal classes, educational movies series, financial workshops on investing and credit rebuilding, lecture series and the list goes on. As it stands now, the Wisconsin Black Historical Society\/Museum is the only institution in the State in the business of preserving African American History in Wisconsin.

Click here for the details. Washburne House was for many years the home of Elihu B. Washburne, United States Congressman from 1853 to 1869. An associate of Abraham Lincoln, Washburne was also a wartime “sponsor” of fellow Galenian Ulysses S. Grant. While following the election returns in the Washburne library on the evening of November 3, 1868, Grant learned of his election as President. Washburne served as Grant’s Minister to France from 1869 to 1877 and in 1879-1880 was considered for the Republican presidential nomination. The original portion of the two-story brick Greek Revival home was built beginning in 1843, with additions in 1859 and 1860. The “restored” home’s first floor interprets an entry hall, parlor, sitting room, library, dining room, and kitchen with adjoining pantries. All are decorated and furnished to depict the lifestyle of a well-to-do midwestern professional. On the second floor are the master bedroom and a second bedroom. In 1973 the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Visitors are given 25-minute guided tours of rooms on the first floor and two second-floor bedrooms, emphasizing the life of Elihu Washburne and his Civil War-era friendships with Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant. The story of Washburne’s wife, Adele Gratiot, provides insights on the Galena region’s French and Native American cultures. The state’s efforts to restore and refurnish the building are also described. The building's first floor is accessible to persons with disabilities, the second floor is not.

I have a general question for the genealogy library. GENEALOGY: submit a FAMILY HISTORY RESEARCH REQUEST Exhibits Themes and Exhibits The People. The story begins with the Native Americans, then the fur traders, quickly followed by the immigrants from Europe. What each generation brought to the Chippewa area provides many fascinating stories. Timber. Having one-sixth of the world’s white pine led the area into supplying the growing Midwest with the lumber needed to construct buildings. Our extensive collection of artifacts from the lumbering era and our new mobile lumberjack museum will enable us to tell the story of the impact of lumbering on this area of Wisconsin. A River. The Chippewa River and the role it played in the Chippewa area provide many stories. They range from carrying logs to the largest saw mill in the world to using large dams and the river’s elevation drop to create electric power and lakes to provide recreation opportunities. Farming. Agriculture has been an important part of the Chippewa story. Early crops included tobacco, sugarbeets, and vegetables. Each crop had its specialized equipment and processes. Farming was the summer occupation of many lumberjacks during the lumbering era. Agriculture today is still a major part of the area’s economy. Military Service. Generations of Chippewa County residents have honorably and humbly served in the military both during conflict and peace time. The stories of these people are shared in the Military Exhibit area. Made in Chippewa. From the lumbering era to the present, many products have been made in the Chippewa Area. All require people, tools, materials, innovation and a market to buy these products. The story of the changes and development over the past century will provide easily altered exhibits. Family History: The Chippewa County Genealogical Society was established in 1980 with a mission to provide education and assistance to those who are tracing their family roots; to collect and maintain genealogical and historical materials; and to provide access to all materials and educational programs for members and the general public. In addition to the above, other themes will be explored and exhibited. Tours tours Interested in scheduling a school field trip or a group tour?

    "homepage_content":"Forest Hill Cemetery | Parks | City of Madison, WI Skip to main content Parks Forest Hill Cemetery The City of Madison Parks Division manages the historic Forest Hill Cemetery, located at 1 Speedway Road, Madison, WI 53705 Click image to enlarge. History In 1857, the City of Madison purchased a tract of land with a lovely view overlooking the entire city and the surrounding lakes. Even today, this tree-lined cemetery, located on Speedway Road, retains an original park-like atmosphere with winding roads and flowerbeds. Since the cemetery was created at the time of the Civil War, one of the most interesting areas for visitors is the two military burial plots for Union and Confederate soldiers. Many Confederate soldiers were held prisoner at nearby Camp Randall. One hundred forty of them died and were buried at Forest Hill. In a nearby plot, 240 Union veterans were buried. Forest Hill Cemetery is one of the first U.S. National Cemeteries in Wisconsin. In an even earlier time, Native Americans used this high ground as a burial ground, evidenced by an Effigy Mound Grouping, where noble warriors are buried. This mound, in the shape of a goose, is located on the southeast side of the cemetery. It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The entire cemetery is filled with a sense of history and a reminder of the families who have played a significant role in the area's development. A brochure (free of charge) that features a map and self-guided walking tour or a publication by Historic Madison, Inc. entitled \"Forest Hill Cemetery: A Biographical Guide to the Ordinary and the Famous Who Shaped Madison and the World\" ($20.00) can be obtained at the Cemetery Office. Rules & Regulations Adopted by the Board of Park Commissioners on September 5, 2023 Forest Hill Cemetery and Mausoleum are owned and operated by the City of Madison. In accordance with Wis. Stat. Sec. 157.11 and Section 8.11 of the Madison General Ordinances, the management and care of the Cemetery has been delegated to the Board of Park Commissioners. It is our goal to ensure effective management, proper maintenance, and to prevent abuse and destruction of the Cemetery. In addition to the ordinance and statutes, the following rules and regulations are set forth to govern Forest Hill Cemetery and Mausoleum. The City reserves the right to amend or change any of these rules or regulations without notice to conform to newly developed cemetery and mausoleum practices or changes in State or local law. The City of Madison assumes no responsibility or liability for objects and\/or plantings placed on Cemetery property.

All lots are sold with maintenance and care. Sale or transfer of title to a lot by the owner of record must be recorded with Cemetery management. The burial rights in an unoccupied lot or part of a lot, and hence the title to a lot, is not a merchantable item and may only be sold or transferred by the owner of record in accordance with No. 3 above or to the City of Madison. If transferred to the City of Madison, the owner will receive the original purchase price of the lot or a proportionate share of the original purchase price if a portion of the lot is occupied or is being retained by the owner of record. All lots must be paid for at the time of sale by the purchaser, or by the funeral home if sale is at time of need. A deed will be issued for all lots sold in the Cemetery.

All markers shall be made of granite or bronze, set flush to the ground, and shall not be more than 30 inches in length and 12 inches in width. Grave Decorations The purpose of the property is as a public cemetery, and as such it is meant to be a welcoming environment for all visitors and a place for solemnity, remembrance, and reflection. Moreover, the City of Madison has long sought to preserve the Cemetery's original style and design as an example of the rural cemetery movement. The City's Parks Division is tasked with the daily maintenance and care of the Cemetery and seeks to ensure that these interests are protected. However, the City does understand that some individual grave decoration is desired as a form of celebration of loved ones, even though such grave decorations may not reflect the City's viewpoint and may impair or hinder the City's ability to adequately care for and maintain the Cemetery. These rules and regulations relating to grave decorations will allow the City to protect and advance its interests at the Cemetery, while allowing for some individual grave decorations at the Cemetery. Grave decorations that are not allowed under this policy will be removed by staff, stored for one month and can be claimed by contacting the Forest Hill Cemetery Office. The City of Madison assumes no responsibility or liability for any decorations placed on Cemetery property. General Rules Bronze or stone vases are permitted when they are an original design element of a grave marker as follows: Vases that are permanently affixed must be within the footprint of the marker. Removable vases installed as an original element on a flush bronze grave marker must be turned upside-down after September 15 Existing concrete planters may remain in place, but additional planters will not be permitted. The following decorations are temporarily allowed following interment: Funeral floral arrangements may be left on graves at the conclusion of interment services. They will be removed after 2 weeks. Personal or decorative items placed on graves following interment services may remain in place for 2 weeks, unless they pose a health, safety, or maintenance hazard. Temporary grave markers furnished by the funeral home may be used to mark graves until stone or bronze grave markers can be installed. Temporary markers will be removed after 60 days, except as approved by the City. For winter burials, temporary markers will be allowed to remain until ground conditions allow for installation of concrete footings. The following decorations are permitted between May 15 and September 15: Natural or artificial flowers are permitted only in vases that meet the above criteria. Flowers will be removed if they become wilted, soiled, weathered, or faded. Cut flowers may be placed on graves at any time and will be removed when they become withered.

Glass ornaments or lights of any kind are not allowed. Planting Regulations Annual and perennial plantings are permitted around family monuments and individual grave markers as follows: The planting area must not exceed the boundaries of the lot(s). Plantings should be planted on the graveside of the memorial. Please ask cemetery staff to determine which side of the marker the grave is. Annual and perennial plants will be cut to the ground in late summer or early fall to facilitate fall clean-up and leaf removal. Dead or diseased or unkempt plant material may be removed by staff as needed. Water faucets are available for public use. Hoses are not permitted. No new or replacement plantings of shrubs or trees will be permitted. Cemetery staff may remove dead, diseased, or overgrown shrubs or trees, or plantings that impede on other gravesites.

Gravesite Flag Maintenance. Gravesite flags should be maintained and well kept. Cemetery staff will remove and dispose of gravesite flags if they are not permissible flags, if the flags become broken, soiled, weathered, or faded, or if they are not placed in the correct location. Flagpoles. The large flagpoles near the Cemetery office, in Section 35, and in the triangle to the north of Section 35 are the property of the City of Madison. The City of Madison determines which flags will be flown on these flagpoles. Acceptable flags are the current United States Flag, the Wisconsin State Flag, and the City of Madison Flag. Other permissible flags may be flown with the prior consent of the Board of Parks Commissioners. The large flagpole and the flag in the Union Rest section are the property of Wood National Cemetery. Only the current flag of the United States may be flown on this flagpole. No other flagpoles will be permitted within the Cemetery. Spring and Fall Cleanup Forest Hill Cemetery is heavily wooded, and the spring and fall cleanup of leaves and branches requires considerable resources. To allow Forest Hill staff time to accomplish the maintenance required efficiently and thoroughly, all grave decorations should be removed from graves after March 1, and again after September 1. Decorations removed by staff will be stored and made available for pickup behind the mausoleum before May 1 and November 1, respectively. Unclaimed items will be discarded after these dates. These dates are an estimation and weather dependent. Forest Hill Mausoleum Crypts and Niches Mausoleum sales will be completed with a Memorial Purchase Agreement.

All caskets and urns must be approved by Cemetery management to meet size specifications of a given 6 crypt or niche. No live flowers or plants are allowed inside the mausoleum, and any found in violation will be removed and discarded. The City of Madison accepts no responsibility to save or replace any such removed items.

    "homepage_content":"HARTFORD, VT HISTORICAL SOCIETY – Hartford, White River Junction, West Hartford, Quechee, Wilder HARTFORD, VT HISTORICAL SOCIETY Welcome! The Hartford VT Historical Society preserves the history and material culture of Hartford Village, West Hartford, White River Junction, Wilder, and Quechee. The society presents educational programs, publishes five newsletters a year, and maintains a wonderful collection of artifacts, photographs, and documents. Hartford’s Story Started in 1761 Hartford, Vermont was chartered on July 4, 1761. Many of the town’s original proprietors lived in Connecticut and were lured by reports of farmland, timber, and powerful rivers. But it was an uncharted place nearly two hundred miles away. Hartford began as a patchwork of small farms. Settlers grew some food and shot the rest. Churches and taverns were social hubs and wool from Merino sheep was an early cash crop. Many served in the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. Early settlers founded their town on a hillside above the White River. They met in the home of Solomon Strong to choose a select board and form a militia. They built roads, mills, and a meetinghouse. After town meetings and church services, they gathered at the commodious home of Freegrace Leavitt, which still stands near the Center of Town burial ground. Hartford residents formed the five villages of Hartford Village, West Hartford, White River Junction, Quechee, and Wilder. Levi Hazen and Joshua Tilden were among those who conducted schools in their homes. In 1807, a network of schools was established across Hartford. Junction House photo by George Fellows. When the railroads came to White River Junction in 1848, Hartford became a center of transportation and industry. By 1849, Samuel Nutt had purchased a sprawling hotel in Enfield, NH, moved it to White River Junction, and opened the Junction House, which thrived on railroad travelers. By 1891, Hartford had an opera house, a bustling train station, electrified office buildings, and a new high school with trained teachers and the latest textbooks. In 1889, William Howard Tucker explored the town’s early documents and published a History of Hartford that records many of the people and events in the town’s past. In 1911, Hartford celebrated its one hundred and fiftieth anniversary with a pageant written by Kate Morris Cone that dramatized scenes from Tucker’s book. Today, the Hartford VT Historical Society displays artifacts from Hartford’s past, assists with family genealogies, presents programs on local history, visits schools, and celebrates our town’s vibrant history.

Growing anger over expensive land, embezzlement of tax money, and collusion between creditors and public officials led small farmers in piedmont North Carolina to form associations, write petitions, and seek peaceful redress of their grievances. A lack of response from the royal government only deepened the Regulators' resolve, and rising frustration later gave way to violence. The Regulator movement ended with their defeat at Alamance. Located on the grounds of the site is the Allen House, a log dwelling characteristic of those lived in by farmers in the Piedmont region of North Carolina.

About the Museum The Robert Frost Stone House Museum at Bennington College, located in Shaftsbury, VT, is a historic homestead and community cultural resource exploring the foundational elements of Robert Frost’s life: poetry and place-based art making; agriculture and the environment; and teaching and learning . The Stone House, built in 1769, is the site where Frost wrote, among other notable poems, “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,” “Nothing Gold Can Stay,” “Fire And Ice,” and the book New Hampshire: A Poem with Notes and Grace Notes , for which he won the first of four Pulitzer Prizes . It is also where he grew apples, planted red pine trees, had a large garden, and kept bees; it was a place of industry and creative activity. We honor this creative legacy through our interpretive tours and seasonal programming, which includes readings, concerts, art exhibitions, workshops, and our annual Holiday Makers’ Market. Exploring the JJ Lankes Gallery JJ Lankes was an important American woodcut artist and longtime collaborator with Frost. They met for the first time at the Stone House in 1924. Both men felt the representation of rural life was essential to understanding America. The Frost Stone House contains several Lankes prints as well as the custom bookplates he designed for Frost. Close Video History of Lankes' Collaboration with Frost Scholar Dr. Welford Taylor discusses artist J.J. Lankes' collaboration with Frost.

Historic sites have a unique way of keeping the lessons of the past before our faces in the present. In 1832, a house was constructed at a dynamic crossroads of geography, culture, and history. It was a time of pivotal change, uncertainty, and critical decisions as decades of accumulating tensions came to a head — the consequences of which have reverberated through nearly two centuries. The house erected at the ancient travel corridor of the Fox-Wisconsin portage was the Fort Winnebago Indian Agency built for John H. Kinzie, Indian sub-agent to the Ho-Chunk (Winnebago) Nation. It exists today as one of the few surviving reminders of that weighty period of the past. The powerful stories embodied by this historic site are ones we cannot afford to forget. The house was opened as a nonprofit museum in 1932. bottom of page",

Boat rentals and concessions are available. A trip to Coolidge State Park is a trip back in time; the park remains essentially the way it was when it was first created in the 1930s. Known for its rustic feel, hillside campsites that give way to dramatic mountain views, and authentic character, Coolidge State Park is the developed recreation centerpiece of the 21,500 acre Calvin Coolidge State Forest, the largest state-owned land holding in central Vermont. Coolidge State Park is the only Vermont park with an entire loop of lean-to campsites, some of which have sweeping views of the Black River valley and the Green Mountains. Many campers feel that sites at Coolidge have the best views in all of Vermont. The park also has a loop of forested campsites, restroom facilities with showers, a hilltop picnic area with a log picnic shelter, a group camping area, and several remote lean-to campsites for those wishing to really escape it all. Within the park, there are miles of hiking trails to explore, several streams home to elusive brook trout, and abundant wildlife. Some visitors are lucky enough to catch a glimpse of a barred owl, a moose, or a black bear. Nearby is the village of Plymouth Notch, the birthplace of Calvin Coolidge, 30th president of the United States. History Image The ski shelter at Calvin Coolidge State Forest, circa 1940 Calvin Coolidge State Forest was established in 1925, when Perry Merrill (then head of State forests and parks) arranged the purchase of a tract of land in Plymouth. He was successful in obtaining funds for the property due to the great public interest in the Coolidge family and popularity of Plymouth Notch. Camp Calvin Coolidge, located in Calvin Coolidge State Forest, was established June 9, 1933 as the third Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp in Vermont. The original Coolidge State Park was built solely by the CCC. They also completed a network of forest highways and carried out extensive reforestation projects. Much of what is now Coolidge State Forest was once cleared for tilled land and pasture, as evidenced by extensive stonewalls and many foundations. In the late nineteenth century there was a small town immediately adjacent to Coolidge State Park (later becoming part of the Forest). Businesses once located there included a store, blacksmith shop, and a hotel. Facilities\/ Amenities There are 36 lean-to sites and 26 tent\/RV sites arranged in two camping loops. There are four restrooms providing flush toilets and hot water, two of which have token-operated hot showers. There is a large picnic shelter and a group camping area. There is also a nature center, horseshoes and a play area. There is a sanitary dump station for RVs, but no hookups. There are also several hiking trails. The nature center, where visitors can learn about the history and wildlife of the area The pavilion at Coolidge can seat up to 70 and offers great views Image The pavilion at Coolidge can seat up to 70 and offers great views Image The nature center, where visitors can learn about the history and wildlife of the area The picnic pavilion at Coolidge can be rented. This open pavilion seats up to 70 people and has electricity, grills, fireplaces, and picnic tables. The pavilion is accessible and a restroom is nearby. Learn more about picnic pavilions Horse Camping Horse camping is permitted at Coolidge State Park where horses are allowed at some of the larger campsites (10, 11, 12, 16, 19, 23). Vermont State Parks is working with the Vermont Horse Council to develop equestrian-specific amenities at Coolidge State Park. There are many miles of Class 3 and Class 4 town highways for riding easily accessible from the park. Some care is needed when bringing large vehicles and trailers into the park due to its steep mountain terrain, so please be sure to view the park overview. We hope to begin adding some infrastructure to improve sites. Longer term, we plan to develop a new group camping area that will have a wash station, portable corrals, hitching posts and a manure disposal area.

GEN Sullivan was the highest-ranking alumnus of Norwich University and served as the 32nd Chief of Staff of the United States Army from 1991 to 1995. GEN Sullivan retired in 1995 after thirty-six years of active military service. He continued to honor active-duty personnel and veterans of the United States Army as President and Chief Executive of the Association of the United States Army and as Chairman of the Marshall Legacy Institute. As Chairman of The Army Historical Foundation, he oversaw a successful capital campaign spearheading the construction of the Museum of the United States Army at Fort Belvoir, VA. Here, at Norwich University, GEN Sullivan served as Chairman of the Board of Trustees from 1995-2016. The Sullivan Museum and History Center owes a profound debt of gratitude to GEN Sullivan.

    "homepage_content":"Why is There a Marble Column in the Middle of a Field in Weybridge? | Seven Days Skip to content Because something really awesome happened here. Spies! Prison escapes! Duping the British army! And hunkering in a musty root cellar with only shriveled roots to eat for 10 days! It was all to avoid capture as the British raided and burned their way through Addison County, trying to ensure that the Continental Army had no supplies to fall back on when they left. Somewhere on winding Weybridge Road, in the shadow of Snake Mountain, lurks a dissolving marble, flat-capped column that looks like it ran away from a Middlebury graveyard in the middle of the night. As I stopped at the roadside and walked down the long, straight path, it was eerily still. With the leaves shifting and a morning fog lingering, accompanied only by distant cricket songs, it certainly felt like entering a graveyard. Except that nobody died here. The town of Weybridge keeps the wide path to this monument mowed, however, so visitors are expected. The overgrown ornamental shrubbery around the site and the black iron fence around the obelisk hints that this place was probably once important. The monument is dedicated to Carlton’s Raid — named for a cabin-burning British commander — and rather stuffily explains: Weybridge was chartered by N[ew] H[ampshire] in 1761 and settled in 1775 by Thomas Sandford, David Stow, Justus Sturdevant & Claudius Britell. Nov. 8, 1778, a party of British Torries & Indians destroyed their houses and effects & carried Sandford & son, Robert D. Stow & son, Claudius C. Britell & son & J. Studevant prisons to Quebec. Their wives and children, after occupying a cellar at this place for 10 days, were taken to Pittsford by our troops. D. Stow died in prison Dec. 31 1778. T. Sandford escaped. The others were discharged in 1782. Erected in 1856 by descendants of the people whose names are carved on it, the monument leaves out all the good parts. Luckily, Middlebury’s Sheldon Museum does not. According to the books Carlton’s Raid by Ida H. and Paul Washington and A History of Weybridge, Vermont by Ida H. Washington, the official story goes like this: Several stubborn families of farmers in Weybridge refused to evacuate to the nearby garrison of Pittsford when news arrived of the impending British invasion. It’s possible that at least some members of those families were more than just “stubborn.” David Stow and Thomas Sandford were captured on Lake Champlain, miles from home “on a trip to get some lumber.” Strangely, they were sailing near sites occupied by the British when lumber should have been more safely obtainable at any of the neighbors’ abandoned homesteads — and without leaving their families alone in the middle of an invasion. In the middle of a cold November. Maybe they were just foolish, maybe they’d already scavenged all the nearby wood, or maybe Stow and Sandford were part of the Continental Army’s effort to feed misinformation to the British by seeding men along the way to act as scouts — men who became bogus informants if they were caught and questioned. Those “informants” must have been amazingly good liars, because the British quickly sent back several boatloads of troops to Québec when Sandford, Stow and others told them they could expect to be greeted by a volley of gunshots from a throng of well-armed Continental soldiers if they continued south. In truth, both supplies and troops were running dangerously short for the revolution and could hardly have defended the nearby fort, let alone the rest of Vermont. But for whatever reason, the British took seriously the colonists’ warnings about the level of resistance they could expect, and sought to cut their losses. A much smaller invasive force continued onward from the lake into Addison County to attack the remaining inhabitants and trash their farms. But once they caught the males of Weybridge, the British had trouble hanging on to them. First Robert Sandford, who was only 10, collapsed by the roadside after marching for several miles and was abandoned there, left to find his way home. Then 15-year-old Clark Stow was released into the custody of a Québec woman and spent the Revolutionary War as her servant. Next, Thomas Sandford tried to sneak a letter home to his wife, but prison guards confiscated it. He didn’t give up. Sandford escaped when a mass of prisoners tunneled out through the walls one night. After this fiasco, the British moved their feisty captives to a lumber mill in Malbaie. But this didn’t end the escape attempts. Claudius Britell, Justus Studevant and others stole a flat-bottomed boat and took off. Unfortunately, they were recaptured. Meanwhile, Sandford wandered for months all across New England, trying to find his way back home. When he finally got there, two of his escaped horses had gone wild, but still recognized him when he called their names. They probably fared better than his farm, which was sold to a family from Connecticut. But Sandford’s fortunes must have recovered somewhat, because 70 years later his descendants were still around to carve the bones of his story into marble.

It's perfect for an afternoon picnic or a quick leg stretch. A placid pond slips over a mill dam, and the 28’ waterwheel of this National Register Historic Site makes its slow way 'round. Nailed to a door-frame in the general store, an old coffee can catches bottle caps, and a porch swing awaits you out front, as does a chat with a friendly guide before beginning your tour. Preserved intact are the 1913 mill itself, the 1890s Murray & Minges General Store, the 1880s Wheathouse, used as an exhibit gallery, the 1913 John Murray House, furnished to the period, and numerous outbuildings. Run by three generations of the Murray Family who closed operations in 1967, the picturesque structures and surrounding land form the last milling complex in the county, meticulously preserved and interpreted by the Catawba County Historical Association since 1980 when restorations began.

(ADGWC) was established in September of 2013. ADGWC is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to the restoration of the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed AD German Warehouse (National Register of Historic Places 1974). We are committed to see this building redeveloped and occupied with a stable primary use compatible with the building and a heritage tourism program. ​ All donations are tax-deductible: ​ ADGWC P.O. Box 436 Richland Center, WI 53581 ​ ​ Recent activities include: The ADGWC purchased AD German's Original 1912 Warehouse adjacent to the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed warehouse which is integral to our development plans; it is currently being used for residential and commercial rental. The design plans for the restoration of the Warehouse have been revised as they move through the historic preservation process; Fundraising is an ongoing process in order to restore this iconic property. ADGWC received a grant of $12,700 from the USDA to assist in exploring potential uses. ADGWC launched the Legacy Terrace Paver program to allow people to have their name, a business name, or the name of someone they want to honor or remember engraved in a paver to be used in a designated area in the property. ADGWC completed the 100 Extraordinary Women segment, which has now received $1.000 pledges from over one hundred women who will be recognized for their generous donations in a unique way in the restoration of the Warehouse. ADGWC has applied for state Historic Tax Credits that could potentially cover over fifteen percent of the cost of the project; ADGWC received the very competitive Save America’s Treasures Grant, of $360,000 matching grant (totaling $720,000) for restoration. In November of 2020 the roof and drainage project was completed. In 2021 we received the TAWANI Foundation Grant of $150,000. Restoration work consists of frieze restoration and other exterior work. Our Calendar of Events continues to draw people of all ages to Richland Center and helps us refine our plans for the Event Space.

She resided there with her husband, Harley Stevens, and their adult daughter, Mertie Stevens—all of whom played a significant role in shaping the local community through real estate development. A lasting testament to Mary Elizabeth’s foresight and influence, the home remained in the Stevens family until 1968, when Mertie, the last surviving family member, bequeathed it to the Clackamas County Historical Society. With its practical construction and refined Craftsman-style details, the house stands as one of the city's finest Edwardian-era residences. Thoughtful restoration, supported by generous donations of period furnishings and textiles, has returned the home to its early 20th-century elegance. As Clackamas County’s only Edwardian house museum, the Stevens-Crawford Heritage House offers a rare glimpse into Mary Elizabeth’s legacy and transports visitors back to the Progressive Era—a time of groundbreaking inventions, social transformation, and modern innovation. FOR GUESTS The Stevens-Crawford House is a two-story home, with the first story only accessible after ascending a small flight of stairs to reach the front porch. Because of this the Stevens-Crawford Heritage House is unfortunately not wheelchair accessible and is not recommended for those who have difficulty ascending and descending stairs.

Originally, this unusual plantation included more than 100,000 densely wooded, mainly swampy acres bordering the five-by-eight mile Lake Phelps, in present-day Washington County. During its 80 years as an active plantation (1785-1865), hundreds of acres were converted into high yielding fields of rice, corn, oats, wheat, beans, peas, and flax; sophisticated sawmills turned out thousands of feet of lumber. By 1865, Somerset Place was one of the upper South's largest plantations.

Aycock Birthplace Plan Your Visit History Support This Site Digital Resources Visit Governor Charles B. Aycock Birthplace Born in rural Wayne County, Charles B. Aycock became the fiftieth Governor of North Carolina in 1901. While Aycock has been traditionally celebrated by citizens and state leaders alike for expanding public education and constructing over 1,000 schools while in office, less attention was given to his involvement with the Wilmington Massacre and Coup of 1898, the violent Red Shirt movement of 1898-1900, or the newspaper propaganda which contributed to his “White supremacy” campaign for governor in 1900. Today the site interprets his legacy as a supporter of education, a segregationist, and a driving force behind the disenfranchisement of Black North Carolinians.

Our Commitment to Diversity, Inclusion, Equity, and Accessibility Land Acknowledgement Justice Statement We honor and celebrate the ancestors who came before us, the original inhabitants of the land now known as the western portion of North Carolina. We honor and celebrate the many cultures that existed on this land when Europeans first arrived, and we acknowledge the thousands of people who lost their lives and their land. We honor and celebrate the present-day Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and all indigenous peoples of Western North Carolina. Adopted Board of Trustees, May 19, 2021 As Long As The Grass… Justice Statement We stand against inequity, injustice, and racism. We acknowledge and support the positive role that recent protests have played in opening the door to real and necessary change. As an organization rooted in the interpretation of our regional history, we also recognize that there is an ongoing need to better represent the diversity of voices that have shaped – and will shape – Western North Carolina. In a region that has been influenced by and benefited from the contributions of these diverse voices, the Western North Carolina Historical Association must equitably reflect our heritage, history, and aspirations. We pledge to do that. Beginning immediately, we will re-evaluate how we operate. Moving forward, we are committed to doing the work to become an inclusive organization in all aspects of our operations. That includes our collections, exhibitions, and programs, not only at our museum, but also in our comprehensive mission of education. It includes our leadership and membership. Over the coming months, we will focus on developing a guiding document to help us intentionally and actively move towards this goal. We are listening. We are learning. We are committed to doing the work to get there. As we embark on this journey, we will seek the involvement of our community, so together, we can reflect on the brilliant, rich and, yes, sometimes painful, history of Western North Carolina. Please join us. Adopted Board of Trustees, June 17, 2020 Progress Report",

Photos: Anthony Taranto. Historic Fort Lee Fort Lee found its place in American history during the 1776 British campaign to control New York City and the Hudson River. Having resisted the British siege of Boston, George Washington turned his attention to the defense of New York City and the Hudson River Valley. Besides constructing fortifications at New York and Long Island, Washington felt it imperative for the army to build and strengthen its defenses along the Hudson River. The British plan, meanwhile, was to control the length of the Hudson with the overwhelming dominance of its Royal Navy. This plan, if successful, would split the Colonies in half â bringing an early end to the American rebellion. In July 1776, the Americans began fortifying this site, which they first named âFort Constitution.â (They later changed the name to âFort Lee,â to honor General Charles Lee, whose army had achieved a major victory at Charleston, South Carolina, that summer.) On the high ground of northern Manhattan opposite Fort Lee, work had already begun on Fort Washington. On July 12, Admiral Richard Howe sent two British ships, the Rose and the Phoenix, up the Hudson. Cannon fire from Fort Washington alone had little effect on their passage; Washington ordered work on Fort Lee to advance as quickly as possible. At General Rufus Putnamâs suggestion, obstructions were sunk in the river channel between the forts. With these in place, and artillery fire from the twin forts, the Americans believed that no British ships would be able to sail past without sustaining severe losses. As the summer of 1776 went on, the largest force of British ships ever to have left English shores was amassing in New York Harbor, and by mid-August, Sir William Howe, British Commander-in-Chief (and brother to Admiral Howe), had assembled an army of over 31,000 British and Hessian troops on Staten Island. On August 22, the British attacked Long Island and five days later forced the Americans to retreat to New York City (at the time, the city comprised only the southern tip of Manhattan Island). In September, the British took New York City and the rest of Manhattan â except for Fort Washington. On November 16, Fort Washington fell to an overwhelming assault by Crown forces, which captured more than 3,000 American troops. Washington realized that with the loss of Fort Washington, Fort Lee was of little military value. He ordered General Nathanael Greene, the commander at Fort Lee, to begin preparations to evacuate the fort. An orderly withdrawal, however, was not in store for the Americansâ¦ On November 20, just four days after taking Fort Washington, General Howe ordered General Charles Cornwallis to convey 5,000 men across the Hudson several miles north of Fort Lee. When word of the advancing army reached Washington, he ordered an immediate retreat, before the Fort Lee troops could be cut off and captured by the British force. Most of the American supplies and artillery had to be left behind. These were indeed among the darkest days for the cause of American independence, leading Thomas Paine to pen his famous words, âThese are the times that try menâs soulsâ¦â Drummer boy at a Fort Lee reenactment.

Established as a “gold dust” office in 1856, it was the first “bank” north of San Francisco. During Jacksonville’s heyday as the governmental, commercial, and social hub of Southern Oregon in the late 1800s, the Beekman’s Bank saw over $40 million in gold cross its counters—equivalent to over $1 billion today! Interact with costumed docents sharing stories of late 19th Century banking practices, gold shipping, and handshake deals. Peer in drawers containing old checks, stage schedules, and paperwork. And here’s your chance to enter the vault that stored those millions in gold! “Banking hours” are 11am to 3 pm Saturday, November 29, then every weekend from December 6th through the 21st. 1863 Beek Bank Museum 110 W. California Street, Jacksonville, OR Admission: FREE! Your donation preserves and maintains this historic legacy! And then there’s Jacksonville’s New Museum… Jacksonville’s 1881 “Old City Hall” building will become the ADA accessible hub for a “Museum without Walls” that incorporates the town’s entire National Historic Landmark District (the first one on the West Coast)! Our Old City Hall History Center base will give you an interactive overview of Jacksonville history and share the many ways that you can explore it through walking tours, Haunted History, trolley rides, photo exhibits, programs and presentations, and more!

He can also be seen walking the streets of our historic residential neighborhoods. He enjoys meeting other pups and can be shy when greeting new people (but he’s trying!), so be sure to stop and say hello.

Jacksonville 1883 (lithograph) When Oregon was admitted to the Union in 1859, Jacksonville was the largest inland trade center in the new state, and Jacksonville and its residents played a dominant role in early Oregon history and statehood. But when the railroad by-passed Jacksonville in the 1880s, the town slowly sank into oblivion. However, that oblivion also proved to be the town’s salvation, preserving the historic buildings, homes, and character that you see today—Jacksonville’s National Historic Landmark District. Today, these landmarks live again through the efforts of the City of Jacksonville, volunteers, and private owners so that you can again experience Jacksonville in its heyday. info@historicjacksonville.org © 2021 Historic Jacksonville, Oregon Featuring Haunted History Victorian Christmas Calendar 2025 Event Dates by Month Main Menu Home Events Then and Now “Behind the Counter” Bank Tours Jacksonville Haunted History Victorian Christmas Victorian Days Walk through History Tour Step Back in Time Walk through History Video Historic Homes Video Historic Cemetery Video “Dip into History” Blogs Beekman Bank Nuggets History Trivia Holiday History Mrs. Beekman Invites You to Call Pioneer Profiles “Thirsty Thursday” Saloon Series Walkabout Wednesday Historic District Highlights Beekman Bank Museum Beekman House Museum About Us Donate",

There’s a lot to learn about this area that so many have called “home”! VIEW EXHIBITS Umatilla County Historical Society Heritage Station Museum The Umatilla County Historical Society, a 501(c)(3) organization, was established in 1974, and each year’s Board of Directors has built upon the vision of its 100 charter members in providing the means to document and share local history. An historic journal, Pioneer Trails , was first published in 1976. It continues to be printed quarterly to document the stories of the people, places and events in Umatilla County. In 1981, contents of the Sturgis Museum at Blue Mountain Community College were donated to the Historical Society, which was the beginning of its collection of historic objects. A storefront gallery opened as headquarters for the Historical Society in 1985. Limited exhibits were installed and Terrific Tuesdays, an educational program series, began. Arrangements were made to convert Pendleton’s 1909 train depot to a museum in 1987. Renovations followed and the exhibits, programs, and collections came under one roof for the first time in 1988. As the organization continued its steady growth, it became apparent that the Historical Society was outgrowing its space. A facility expansion was completed in the Fall of 2003. The depot was renovated for use as exhibit galleries, and a new entry building and preservation wing were constructed to provide space for a classroom, a museum store, offices, work space and artifact storage. The over $2.8 million project also included a courtyard, landscaping of the museum grounds, and construction of a small open-air amphitheater. Become a Member!

Registration Details Discover All Events The profound sense of history I experienced the first time I stood alongside the Clarke House where Washington saw the battle before him and rode down into the midst of it to take command and rally his men to victory. James Cunningham Remember the Battlefield I will never forget the long and hard fight with the Institute for Advanced Study over the preservation of Maxwell’s Field where George Washington order a counterattack that swept the British from the field of battle. During that time when the preservation of this field was very much in doubt, I visited Maxwell’s Field and could see first hand how important it was to tell the whole story of the Battle of Princeton. I could also see the bulldozers and compromised land and it made me sick. Thanks to the effort of the PBS and American Battlefield Trust this threat was avoided. John Cassulo Remember the Battlefield In January of 1998 I “encouraged” my then 13 year old daughter to attend the Reenactment at the Battlefield by agreeing to buy new dance outfits for her at Capezio. No other interest in attending. It was incredibly cold and we needed to wait in a long line to get buses back to the parking lot. To this day we both remember it as one of the best father-daughter days out. Today of course she is fully aware of the blessings of growing up in the backyard of history. John Magovern Remember the Battlefield September 2021, I visited the Thomas Clarke house on my way to a new job in Maine. As a direct descendant of BG Hugh Mercer and a combat (Afghanistan) wounded soldier myself felt I needed to pay a visit to the battlefield that my ancestor gave his life. The staff were amazing and answered questions I had about the battlefield and I told them about the little village in Scotland where BG Mercer was born\/raised (which I had visited a couple years before). Very glad BG Mercer’s memory is kept alive and honored.

All can lend a hand and help put the finishing touches on a quilt by the tie method. Antique quilts dating from 1840’s to early 1900’s will be on display throughout the farmhouse. A special children’s “scavenger hunt” on the farm for the sources of traditional quilt pattern names will be ongoing and will include farm chores. Children that complete the scavenger hunt can choose colorful squares from the Howell Farm fabric basket and see their pieces sewn together on a treadle sewing machine. Vintage and present-day quilts will also be on display in the Howell Farm visitor center Fish barn. See firsthand how colorful feed sacks were used in quilting or try your hand arranging log cabin squares into patterns of “Barn Raising”, “Fields & Furrows”, or “Sunshine & Shadows”. Vote for your favorite quilt while you warm yourself with homemade lunch fare that will be available for purchase in the visitor center. Reserved Group Programs Wheat Planting & Thresting September – October In this unique program, children learn farming from the ground up: starting in the field and ending in the kitchen! Participants begin by helping farmers prepare the ground for a crop of winter wheat: tilling the field, sowing seeds by “hand broadcasting”, and comparing this method to mechanical planting. Using Howell Farm wheat cut earlier this year, kids fast-forward to the next summer harvest – first learning how farmers bundle the stalks into sheaves, then stacking the sheaves into a free-standing “shock.” The hands-on work continues, threshing the wheat with a flail and separating it from the chaff by winnowing with a hand-crank fanning mill. After learning how farmers would then store and process wheat – in the past and today – children finally pay a visit to the farmhouse kitchen to taste bread baked with flour ground from the same wheat grown on the farm. Farm Animals In a 90-minute sampler of the Howell Farm morning chores, children meet horses, sheep, pigs, and chickens, learning how a farmer’s family works to keep the animals healthy, warm, and productive during the coming winter. Participants help shell and grind corn for animal feed, look for eggs in the henhouse, and help the farmer with other work around the farm.

Article This memorial honors all Native American warriors who have proudly fought for the rights and freedom of this great Nation. Jefferson whitewolfpack.com 7 November 2912 Although Bill and Gwin Stam of Jefferson purchased a life-size rendering of an American Indian on a horse trying to take down a pair of buffalo with a spear, the statue really belongs to and is dedicated to American Indians veterans everywhere. Bill, 77, a Lakota, and Gwin, 73, an Apache, bought the Fiberglas statue in Montana. Bill Stam and friend Gary Cherry of Tillamook put it on a flatbed trailer in August and with the help of numerous volunteers erected it in the Stams’ front yard on Cemetery Hill Road. The Stams believe that their All Nations Native American Veterans Memorial is the only memorial open to the public that pays respects to all nations, tribes and bands in the United States. There are other memorials but those are on reservations and honor members of that tribe. Bill Stam spotted the statue after he and Cherry delivered clothing to the Blackfoot nation at a nearby reservation. The two were taking photographs of the statue placed at a restaurant and museum when they noticed a for sale sign. Stam called the owner and learned that because the statue hadn’t sold it was going up for sale on the Internet the next day. Stam, who is active in several veterans organizations in the Willamette Valley, arranged to buy the statue after talking it over with his wife. He declined to say how much he paid for it. Stam, a combat Navy veteran of the Korean War and a combat Air Force veteran of the Vietnam War with a total of 24 years in the service, estimates the statue could weigh about 3,000 pounds. It is 15 feet long, 14 feet high and 80 inches wide. Since erecting the memorial, the Stams have set up a small water feature to its right and added two slate tablets. One will hold the names of American Indian veterans and the other will have names of the special sponsors that have helped make the memorial possible. . Still to go up are flag poles that will fly the American, state, POW and tribal flags. . When the weather improves, Gwin will paint eyes on the buffalo and a American Indian blanket on the horse. Behind the memorial are two teepees used to portray tribal culture. Gwin is painting panels that will hang inside the teepees. Individuals, families or businesses donating $100 or more will have their name placed at the memorial. The Stams are in the process of trying to become a nonprofit but don’t as yet have the status. American Indian veterans making a donation of $35 or more will have their names inscribed on a 2-inch by 4-inch plaque. . Veterans can contact the Stams at 541-327-2949 to learn more about submitting their information for a plaque. They need to provide their names, tribal affiliation, city, branch of service and if any medals were received. . Information about the project also is available on Facebook, by searching online for All Nations Native American Veterans Memorial, Jefferson, Oregon. . Because the memorial is located in a rural part of Jefferson, Stam asked the Jefferson City Council to approve placing directional signs on state and county roads that point the way to the memorial. The council agreed to help out, said City Recorder Sarah Cook. . Those wishing to visit the memorial are asked to come in the afternoon, but other arrangements can be made. 'Forgotten War' - New Book by Henry Reynolds Henry Reynolds argues that until the frontier war conflicts are fully acknowledged, reconciliation will never be complete - more revealing evidence of the war conflicts.

In celebration of our glorious past, the Lakewood Historical Society propagates and reinforces our unique heritage in partnership with the Sheldon Wolpin Lakewood Historical Museum to provide a venue to educate and exhibit Lakewood history. The mediums for expression will provide Lakewood schools, organizations, the overall surrounding communities and general population with an opportunity to educate, immerse and gain insight into Lakewood's splendid history and ever-changing present. Dr. Stan Liptzin President Executive Committee: Steve Wexler, Vice President Robin Taylor-Wellet, Treasurer Armen Hagopian, Secretary ﻿ Upcoming Events UUP Please join us at the Sheldon Wolpin Historical Museum on 11\/19\/23 to meet our very own Marilyn Wolpin , author of \"Bring Back the Babka\" as she debuts her beautifully illustrated children's book. Time: 2:00p.m. to 3 p.m. - Refreshments to follow. (Kosher of course!) Book will be available for purchase and signing. Please R.S.V.P. to Robin at (732) 330-5384 or rwellet@aol.com Sheldon Wolpin Sheldon Wolpin, a Lakewood native, dedicated his adult life to preserving and passing on to others the rich heritage of his town. Mr. Wolpin was chairman of the Lakewood Heritage Commission for more than 20 years. Without his leadership, guidance and perserverence, the many accomplishments of the commission, including the establishment of the museum, would not have been possible. Sheldon Wolpin Lakewood Historical Museum On June 27, 2012, the Lakewood Historical Society was able to formulate a lease with the Township of Lakewood for the use of Kuser Hall in the Pine Park section of Lakewood. As Chairperson of the Society, Dr. Stan Liptzin had the distinct honor and pleasure to sign this lease for the Society. It is the aim of the Lakewood Historical Society that the Museum will be considered﻿ a community enterprise. As Lakewood's population continues to be fluid, pluralistic, and more diverse, the Museum will offer all groups, both ethnic and religious, space to portray their heritage's involvement in the development of Lakewood. Although the Lakewood Heritage Commission dates back to 1984, the first short-lived museum opened its doors in the original Lakewood High School auditorium in 2004. The abbreviated history of this museum was abruptly ended when the Board of Education sold the then School Administration building. Our museum, which was housed in the auditoruim of the Princeton Avene School building, consisted of permanent displays, provided presentations of past eras and events, sponsored Victorian teas and appropriate period performances and community and regional events such as recognition of the Boys and Girls Scouts of Lakewood, the Model Railroad Society of Ocean County as well as hosting various \"Walks Down Memory Lane\" honoring past eras so intertwined and linked to Lakewood life. With the close supervision of the Museum, the Historical Society and Heritage Commission have been working assiduously to find a new home for our rich collection of collector's items, memorabilia, personal effects and possessions. A museum in storage impedes the goal of sharing with the community. After too many years of frustrating attempts to find a home, the Lakewood Township Committee has worked hand-in-hand with the Lakewood Historical Society and Lakewood Heritage Commisssion to provide a permanent residence for the museum! Kuser Hall, in Pine Park, Lakewood is a former school-classroom building constructed in 1927. This building is ideal for a museum with its many classrooms, science laboratories and large assembly room. The structure itself is of historic nature and has many worthwhile period items inherent in the building which will be retained. The goal is to create museum space within the confines of Kuser Hall to house our rich and splendid collection and provide a permanenet location and setting to share with the community the benefits of knowledge associated with our unique history! The entire first floor of Kuser Hall, where our exhibits are located, is accessible by wheelchair. Please reach out to us if you are visiting the museum and have accessibility concerns. We are happy to accomodate you.

This bustling plantation included: •Fruit Orchards •Lumberyard •Shad Fishery •Livestock •Ferry Together, Ann and James raised nine children who worked the plantation alongside dozens of indentured servants hailing from Ireland, the Netherlands, and Germany. American Revolution In 1777, the American Revolution interrupted life at Red Bank when American forces constructed Fort Mercer immediately north of the house. On October 22, 1777, Colonel Christopher Green's Rhode Island Regiment inflicted heavy losses on Hessian soldiers and the Whitall's home served as a field hospital. Hundreds of Hessian soldiers lost their lives in the battle and were buried just north of the house. The Whitall's never forgave the American forces for the devastation they inflicted on their beloved property. Tours Tours of the Whitall House are available from April through October, Thursday-Sunday 11am-3pm. ▲ Back to top Current Alerts Sign Up for Alerts Open Government Learn More Agendas & Minutes Find Meeting Information RFP\/Bid Opportunities Documents and Information Assessment Records View Records Newsletters Sign Up Get Notifications Government Websites by CivicPlus® Loading Loading Do Not Show Again Close Arrow Left Arrow Right [] Slideshow Left Arrow Slideshow Right Arrow",

The original school was established in 1902 and served the town for almost 50 years, teaching the \"three R's\" to the children of the northern end of Long Beach Island until 1951. In 1954, on our Borough's 50th year, the schoolhouse was dedicated as the town's museum. This unique small museum stands in the shadow of the Barnegat Lighthouse, the second oldest lighthouse on the Northeastern seaboard. Not only is the old school building an interesting example of period architecture, it also contains a remarkable varied array of exhibits relating to the history of the town, the fishing industry and Long Beach Island—including being the home of the Lighthouse's original first-order lens. Come visit Barnegat Light! Climb the Lighthouse and view the world of today in a spectacular panoramic scene. Then visit our museum and step back into the slower paced but wonderful world of yesterday. We guarantee your experience will be memorable.

    "homepage_content":"The Capt. Charles McDowell, Jr. House at Quaker Meadows | Historic Landmark, Museum, & Event Venue top of page The Captain Charles McDowell, Jr. House at Quaker Meadows The place name “Quaker Meadows” was given to the area by Joseph McDowell (1715-1771). He received two Crown Patents in 1749 and 1780. The acreage in the earlier grant contained a large meadow. Joseph named the area Quaker Meadows after his home in Frederick County, Virginia. On this property, Joseph’s sons, Revolutionary War leaders Charles and Joseph, gathered the Overmountain Men on September 30, 1780. These patriot soldiers from Virginia, current-day Tennessee, and Wilkes and Surry Counties in North Carolina, met under a giant oak tree now known as the Council Oak and laid plans leading to the defeat of the loyalists under British Major Patrick Ferguson at the Battle of Kings Mountain, a turning point of the Revolutionary War in the South. The house at Quaker Meadows was built in 1812 by Captain Charles McDowell, Jr. in anticipation of his marriage the following year to his cousin, Anna McDowell of Pleasant Gardens. By1850, Charles and Anna had created a thriving estate of over 1500 acres including 52 enslaved people. Here they reared their six children and three orphaned relatives, including Harriet Epsy, future wife of two-time North Carolina Governor (1862-65) and (1877-79) Zebulon Baird Vance. The house was a center of social activity in antebellum Burke County. Both Charles and Anna died in 1859. Their only surviving son, Colonel James Charles McDowell, was killed in action during the Civil War. Architecture An outstanding example of vernacular federal style architecture, the house was constructed of brick made on site and laid in the Flemish bond pattern on a foundation of coursed granite rubble. It features a corbelled brick cornice and tall exterior end chimneys. Window and door openings are topped with flat jack arches. Built on the “Quaker” or “continental” floor plan typical to Pennsylvania and the Shenandoah Valley, it has twin entries both front and back, one large room on one side of an enclosed stairway, and two rooms on the other side. One of several Catawba Valley plantation homes built on this plan, Quaker Meadows is the oldest known brick structure in Burke County. The bricks were handmade at Quaker Meadows. The elaborate mantel and wainscoting in the parlor are thought to have been brought up from Charleston because the work workmanship is more sophisticated than that found in the other rooms or other early houses in the area. Wallpapers used in the house are reproductions of patterns from the period 1810-1840 and were donated by the manufacturer, Twigs, of Venice, California. Donated to Historic Burke Foundation by Crescent Land and Timber Corporation in 1986, the house has been restored to its 1812 appearance, and the detached kitchen, known as the Kistler Kitchen, has been reconstructed on its original foundation. A lovely kitchen garden, located at the rear of the house, is maintained by the Mimosa Garden Club Each September, Historic Burke Foundation, along with community volunteers, descendants of Burke County Revolutionary War patriots, Overmountain Victory Trail Association members, and the public, commemorate the September 1780 gathering under the Council Oak at Quaker Meadows. Events include Living History Days for Burke County 4th graders, a commemorative Crossing of the Catawba River at Greenlee Ford, and an afternoon of colonial activities at the Captain Charles McDowell, Jr. House. The house is open for tours by appointment with the required advance notice. Donations of $5 for adults are welcome (free for children aged 12 and under). It is available for private events and meetings with a rental fee, deposit, and staff. Please contact us for details. ​ bottom of page",

The Village was a self-sufficient community containing a carpentry and pattern making shop, a blacksmith shop, a bakery, a boarding house, a blast furnace, mills to finish iron products, a school, a church, a general store with a post office, and workers’ home. Iron produced at the village was shipped to New York City by wagon and steamship. It was used to produce steam engines parts in a factory also owned by our proprietor, James P. Allaire. The Howell Iron Works, as a community, speaks to the experiences of the economic and social changes of those who experienced early Industrial America. Today the Historic Village at Allaire is an interactive museum where visitors can experience history directly through hands-on activities. Read More",

The Collection presents artists from Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan, who stood for their freedom of expression, despite the harassment and prosecution that they faced from Soviet-era authorities. These artists’ resistance to the constraints imposed on all aspects of life at that time gains new relevance today and should strengthen our resolve to preserve the open societies they fought for.

Event Date Wed, Nov 19 2025, 7 - 8pm Nutley Historical Society Will Host a Program Honoring Hall of Fame Cyclist Tino Reboli on Nov. 19 at Museum Tino Reboli at the Nutley Velodrome, undated photo, courtesy of the Jeff Groman Collection The Nutley Historical Society will host a special program to honor Tino Reboli, the award-winning golden age bicycle racer and a fan favorite at the legendary Nutley Velodrome, on Wednesday Nov. 19 at 7 p.m. The event will be held at the Nutley Museum, 65 Church Street. The program is free and open to the public. Light refreshments will be served. A former Nutley resident, Reboli was inducted into the U.S. Bicycling Hall of Fame, Davis, CA, on October 18. Born and bred in New Jersey, Reboli was one of the most popular and successful pro bike riders in the 1930s. He competed in Motorpace (riding in the slipstream of a motorcycle), grueling Six-Day races, and track and road races. He was part of the world-class field of cyclists when the Nutley Velodrome held its inaugural races on Sunday, June 4, 1933, before a standing-room-old crowd of 12,000 fans. Reboli, during the 1930s, competed at cycling tracks in Chicago, Detroit, New York, Buffalo, Cleveland, Milwaukee and San Francisco. Reboli won the 1938 national professional Motorpace championship, held at the Nutley Velodrome. High-speed motorpacing was a glamorous but dangerous part of the sport, as cyclists “drafted” behind motorcycles. As an amateur, he captured the Newark national junior road race championship in 1929, then went on to win the state senior road racing titles in 1931 and 1932. Chester (Tino) Reboli was born in Newark in 1913 and died on November 18, 1985. Event Date Sat, Dec 6 2025, 9 - 11am The Nutley Museum Presents . . .

Civil Rights Museum About Us The Route Freedom House Significance How It All Started In 1963 George & Rembert Washington, grocery store owners experienced the full assault of the citizens counsel when they decided to support the Civil Rights Movement by allowing George Raymond, then director of C.O.R.E. in Canton, MS to rent a house now known as The Freedom House on George Washington Ave. to live and work in. The segregationists would retaliate by instituting what was called the first boycott of a black-owned business in Canton. They moved the gas pumps and forbade all wholesalers to sell and deliver groceries and dry good to their store. How It All Started Freedom House Significance How It All Started George Raymond from New Orleans, LA, a freedom rider would be considered the most committed leader of the movement in Canton representing C.O.R.E.

Biloxi Lighthouse Live feed from inside the Biloxi Lighthouse The Biloxi Lighthouse was erected in 1848 and was one of the first cast-iron lighthouses in the South. It is the city’s signature landmark and has become a post-Katrina symbol of the city’s resolve and resilience. The Biloxi Lighthouse was one of three Mississippi Sound lighthouses authorized in 1847 by legislation sponsored by Mississippi Representative Jefferson Davis. A one-acre tract for the lighthouse and keeper’s dwelling was purchased from John Fayard for $600, and metal plates, cast by Murray and Hazlehurst Vulcan Works in Baltimore under a contract for $6,347, were bolted together to form the lighthouse, which was strengthened by a brick lining. The tower was completed in the spring of 1848 under the supervision of Henry Scoles, and Marcellus J. Howard was assigned as the first keeper. Part of Keeper Howard’s job was to service the nine lamps and fourteen-inch reflectors, supplied by Winslow Lewis, that comprised the lighting apparatus. In 1856, a fourth-order Fresnel lens replaced the array of lamps and reflectors. The light was civilian operated from 1848 to 1939, and is notable for its several female lightkeepers, including Maria Younghans, who tended the light for 53 years. In 1939, the U.S. Coast Guard assumed responsibility for the light’s operation. After being declared surplus property in 1968, the Biloxi Lighthouse was deeded to the City of Biloxi, which eventually opened it to public tours. The lighthouse has withstood many storms over the years. Katrina’s storm surge enveloped a third of the 64-foot-tall lighthouse, and the constant pounding from the water and winds toppled many bricks that lined the interior of the cast-iron tower. The storm’s winds also broke many of the windows in the light cupola and destroyed the structure’s electrical system In March 2010, the city re-opened the lighthouse to public tours after a 14-month, $400,000 restoration that was funded by FEMA and MEMA and completed by Biloxi contractor J.O. Collins. Video and photos: To see a 12-minute documentary about the Biloxi Lighthouse, narrated by Biloxi native and Miss America 1959 Mary Ann Mobley, click here .

As the Smithville Historic District, the village is listed on the National and New Jersey Registers of Historic Places. Smithville grew from a typical, small mill operation on the Rancocas Creek to a major industrial plant employing hundreds of workers in its shops and yards from the 1860s to the 1920s. Known for its high-quality woodworking machinery, the Smithville-Mt. Holly Bicycle Railroad, and the Star high wheeled bicycle, Smithville was also well ahead of its time in town planning, sustainability, and workers’ rights and welfare. Within its borders, it offered its residents and workers a variety of recreational, artistic and educational opportunities. Smithville was, in just about every way, a model industrial town. In addition to its intriguing past, this 312-acre park features a diverse collection of habitats and terrain. With upland forests and meadows, freshwater streams and wetlands, creek shoreline and the 22-acre Smithville Lake, visitors can enjoy hiking, biking, fishing, canoeing and picnicking in an idyllic, natural setting. Smith's Woods Area is on the opposite side of Smithville Rd. from the Historic District and is accessed from East Railroad Ave. This section includes picnic pavilions and picnic areas with grills, a playground, restrooms, butterfly garden, and hiking trails.

    "homepage_content":"Mississippi's Final Stands Skip to content “It was the last romantic, and first modern war.” -Shelby Foote Explore the Battlefields MS Final Stands offers an in-depth exploration of two defining Civil War battlefields – the Battle of Tupelo and the Battle of Brice’s Crossroads. These places serve as poignant reminders of our history, where courage, fear, and dedication painted an unforgettable scene of the Civil War. The vivid portrayal of these strategic clashes invites visitors to delve into the past and uncover the stories etched in their landscapes. The Battle of Tupelo, fought in July 1864, was a significant conflict aimed at preventing the Confederate Army from threatening Union supply lines. The site brings to life the intense battle and its pivotal role in the Union’s western campaign. On the other hand, the Battle of Brice’s Crossroads, held a month earlier, was famed for its tactical genius staged by Confederate Major General Nathan Bedford Forrest against a much larger Union force. Serving as a memory of the strategic maneuver that led to a Confederate victory, Brice’s Crossroads offers a vivid journey through the past. MS Final Stands portrays these historical events with an accuracy and respect that has the power to take one back in time. Interpretive Center Hours & Admission Mon – SAT | 9AM – 4:30PM $7 per person; no charge under 7 years of age Brice's Crossroads Tupelo\/Harrisburg Timeline Spring 1864 In the spring of 1864, the Union’s plan for war in the Western Theater was to divide the South. Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman’s task was to destroy the Army of Tennessee, occupy Atlanta, and march to the sea to apply pressure against the Confederacy. Early in the Atlanta Campaign, the Confederate high command contemplated attacking Sherman’s main supply line, the Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad, to disrupt his progress. June 1864 Maj. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest’s mounted infantry set out towards Tennessee on June 1st and reached Russellville, Alabama, before Maj. Gen. Stephen D. Lee ordered them to return to Tupelo. On June 10th, Forrest engaged in battle with Brig. Gen. Samuel Sturgis’ Union force outside of Brice’s Crossroads. Although Forrest won the battle due to his tactical use of more mobile cavalry and Union troops were routed, their retreat was covered by the 55th & 59th USCT Troops. Brice’s Crossroads was a brilliant tactical victory, but the battle did not relieve the Confederacy. July 1864 The goal in July was to keep Maj. Gen. Nathan B. Forrest in Mississippi and maintain the Atlanta Campaign’s supply lines. Maj. Gen. Andrew J. Smith set out from Memphis on that task and engaged with Confederate forces, consisting of Forrest and Lieut. Gen. Stephen D. Lee’s reinforcements outside of Tupelo on July 14th. The Union forces – which included the 61st & 68th USCT – repulsed the uncoordinated Confederate attacks, inflicting heavy casualties.

It’s the perfect place to host a wedding, banquet, business meeting, or personal milestone. History of the Freight Shed Built in 1935 by the National Park Service after a tropical storm destroyed much of the waterfront, the original building was used as a terminal for Baltimore steamships until 1952. Then, it was remodeled and served as a post office. The current facility, extensively renovated in 2005 in conjunction with the opening of Riverwalk Landing, is around 1,950 square feet with a large brick plaza on the river side of the building. Weddings with a View! The gorgeous views of the York River, coupled with stunning sunsets, provide breathtaking backdrops for photography on your big day! The Freight Shed can accommodate seated ceremonies and receptions of up to 130 people. Beautiful glass, arched doors open up to Riverwalk Plaza, which offers an additional tented area that can be used for the ceremony, cocktail hour, and dancing. Be sure to ask about our special weekly wedding rates that can fit into almost any budget.

Last week’s Delta Coterie Christmas Party was a big success, bringing nearly 75 visitors to the Wildlife Heritage Museum who had not been here before. Most were excited and enthusiastic at seeing the many exhibits and history, and promised to come back during the Christmas holidays, bringing their children and grandchildren for lengthy visits. If your organization would like to have a reception, etc at the Mississippi Wildlife Heritage Museum, call M-F 10-5 @ 662-686-7085, or Gaila Oliver, Sec\/Treas, @ 662-820-9555 to scout and book a visit. LET US TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO WISH ALL Y’ALL A MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!! Speaking of which, Leland Author PAUL ABRAHAM will be at the Museum on Tuesday, Dec. 12, to sign copies of his first book, THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ABRAHAM. You have friends and family who need this book for Christmas! Also available at the Museum Gift Shop this Christmas are books by Outdoor Authors and Lelanders ROBERT HITT NEILL, BILLY JOHNSON, JIM McCAFFERTY, and former Mayor Perrin Grissom plus Mississippians BILLY JOE CROSS, CARROLL LEATHERMAN, BRUCE BRADY, MINOR BUCHANAN, & MIKE McCALL. Shop with us at the Museum! Both Special Events this past week were well-attended and well-received! Folks from as far south as Brookhaven and as far north as Memphis came to THE Mississippi Wildlife Heritage Museum for good times with good friends and learned even more about our Wildlife Heritage, in Holt Collier and Ducks Unlimited. Then today (Thur, 9\/21) the wives — a whole school (to stay in context) of good-looking ladies — of fishermen engaged in a Crappie Masters Tournament were guests of the Leland Wildlife Museum, then journeyed to the other Leland Museums — Highway 61 Blues & Jim Henson — as well as to several downtown stores. We would welcome, now that school has started, tours of the Wildlife Museum by school children — just call ahead and schedule the visits (children must be accompanied by responsible (!) adults. Come to downtown Leland for a great time — but please don’t pet our bears! See y’all at the Museum! HOLT COLLIER, HIS ROOSEVELT HUNTS AND THE ORIGIN OF THE TEDDY BEAR, on Friday evening, September 15th, 6 to 8 P.M. Reception with hors d’oeuvres, wince, & punch, at 302 N. Broad St, Leland. Come and enjoy an Evening With Holt Collier! Tuesday the 19th, the Museum will host a Ducks Unlimited Reception, tickets for which are available at the Museum. Come on by, but plan to spend at least an hour or so, to see all the exhibits. Hours are 10 to 5, M-Sat. We just bought another sign-in book for the Museum, for the first one is almost full. At a Bored meeting two weeks ago, I had gone through the book for my Secretary\/Treasurer’s Report, and counted 984 people who had signed in since the June 2nd\/3rd Grand Opening, from 20 states and 4 foreign countries! Just this week, we’ve had visitors from Switzerland, Italy, New Zealand, and Australia. Come on over and share our Outdoor Heritage! There are two major events scheduled for the Mississippi Wildlife Heritage Museum in September. On Friday the 15th, author Minor Buchcanan will have a book-signing here, after a talk at the Rotary Club at noon. And on Tuesday the 19th, the Museum will host a Ducks Unlimited Reception, tickets for which are available at the Museum. Come on by, but plan to spend at least an hour or so, to see all the exhibits. Hours are 10 to 5, M-Sat. Since the June 2nd & 3rd Grand Opening, with over 1000 folks in attendance, we’ve averaged 15 to 25 visitors to the Museum each day (M-Sat, 10 to 5). Last week a lady from south Kentucky dropped by for the tour, and she had over each shoulder a purse, one small, one bigger and bulkier. I offered to tote the big one, but she said it wasn’t heavy and declined. After her tour, however, she decided to visit the Gift Shop (T-shirts, calls, books, etc) and picked some of the books, to be signed by the author present. When she stepped up to the counter to pay, she set the larger purse on the window seat, right between two mounted predators — a gray fox and a bobcat. The signing author messed up his signature when suddenly a loud growl, then a chorus of excited — nay, even frightened! — barks suddenly emanated from the bulky purse!! The Kentucky lady whirled around to open the purse, which contained not one, but two, little bitty dogs — Pomeranians, maybe? not Labs or Beagles — who had not uttered a peep during their tour of the Museum, until being abandoned by their mistress to be possible suppers for two much bigger animals! The lady, actually a judge at home, hushed the pups quickly by moving their disguised cage to a safer place, but we both then wondered: 1) had some long-suppressed instinct aroused the little canines to their perceived danger, or 2) was there still some cat or fox odor attached to the long-mounted bodies that triggered the danger signals to the dogs? Whatever, the little ones were glad to leave the Mississippi Wildlife Heritage Museum unscathed that day! Saturday, July 15th, saw the new Mississippi Wildlife Heritage Museum filled up again, as we held a special Reception for Melvin Tingle, who was being inducted into the Mississippi Outdoor Hall of Fame. At least 150 people gathered to honor the long-time Outdoor Television Show Host, as MWHM President Billy Johnson presented Mr. Tingle with his plaque and unveiled his Hall of Fame Showcase. Additional items and artifacts are coming in daily for display, from sportsmen and women, or their descendants who have been moved to honor this new Museum with the things that have made God’s Great Outdoors such a wonderful part of their own upbringing. Their stories, perhaps over a cup of coffee on the camo sofas, bring laughter, joy, and tears, when those memories are re-lived. Plan that trip to the Museum today! By the way: Admission is $10, or $7 for Seniors (over 60) and those in groups of at least five. Kids under 16 are free, accompanied by adults. Check out our Memberships Page, and become a Friend of the Wildlife Heritage Museum, to ensure free entrance wherever you’d like to visit. Y’all come — to Leland, for the ultimate Wildlife Experience! Hope y’all had a Happy Fourth of July!! Here at the Mississippi Wildlife Heritage Museum in Leland, we took that day off from our first month of being open at the Museum, during which we have averaged about 15 guests a day who have come to see the trophies, pictures, exhibits, and all the wonderful outdoor accouterments which are displayed within this almost 15,000 sq. ft. Museum. Hot coffee is brewed each morning, and some guests prefer lounging on the sofas after completing their tour, to hear stories and tales by some of the older sportsmen attracted by the strong beverage each morning. Veracity is not necessarily required, nor appreciated, by these dispensers of Outdoor Wisdom! Take a day off from your normal routine and drive up to Leland to check out our state’s newest Museum! WOOOOWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!! WHAT A GRAND OPENING! Over a thousand guests poured through the new Mississippi Wildlife Heritage Museum at the Grand Opening on Friday, June 2nd, and Saturday, June 3rd!!! Outdoor Industry heavyweights, Hunters, Fishermen, Outdoorsmen & Outdoorswomen with their Outdoorskids, the curious, the passers-by, and the hungry who smelled catfish frying as they headed out after work… these and many more entered the doors of the old Joe Turner Hardware Store at the main intersection in Leland, Mississippi, to see that elderly dark & dingy building turned into a bright new world of almost every joy the Great Outdoors has to offer. The Mississippi Outdoor Hall of Fame formally inducted the seventeen members who have so far been voted in — from former slave and bear hunter Holt Collier, born in 1846 to today’s Mississippi films\/camo\/calls Kings trio of Toxey Haas, Ronnie “Cuz” Strickland, and Will Primos — with appropriate and deserved praise and even a little preaching! “God’s Great Outdoors” was the theme of several honoree’s remarks. The Museum will now be open M-F 10A to 5P, with special openings on request (662-686-7085) if one calls during business hours to arrange viewings. If that number is busy, try President Billy Johnson (662-347-4223) or Sec\/Treas Gaila Oliver (662-820-9555), again, during business hours. Admission is $10 for adults, children under 16 free (accompanied by adults), with special discounts for Seniors (60+) @ $7, and Groups (5+) @ &7. Bring the family and spend the day. The Grand Opening will be at the recently renovated Mississippi Wildlife Heritage Museum at 304 North Broad Street, Leland, MS For More Information: Gaila Oliver, Sec\/Treas 662-820-9555, or Billy Johnson, Pres, 662-347-4223 Leland’s newest pending Museum, the MS Wildlife Heritage Museum in the old Joe Turner Hardware Store building has been completely renovated. The MS Wildlife Heritage Museum On April 21st, 2017, which is the 90th Anniversary of the Great Mississippi River Flood of 1927, the Museum hosted a Great Flood Exhibit with photos and items, to commemorate this greatest natural disaster in American history. A Reception with heavy hors d’oeuvres and drinks was held from 5:30 to 7:30, featuring an address by Peter Nimrod, Chief Levee Board Engineer. The Exhibit will be open for a month, and will open on request between 10A & 4P M-F, with special opening requests arranged by calling Billy Johnson President, (662-347-4223), or Gaila Oliver Secretary\/Treasurer, (662-820-9555). Grand Opening for the Mississippi Wildlife Heritage Museum is scheduled for Friday, June 2nd and Saturday, June 3rd, 2017. The MWHM hosted the Smithsonian Institution’s Hometown Teams Traveling Exhibit during the month of September, with nearly 200 people viewing the Exhibit as well as the newly renovated Museum. The MS Department of Humanities co-sponsored the HTT Exhibit, which then moved to DSU until December, coordinated by Emily Jones, the Delta State Archivist. The Wildlife Heritage Museum will now be arranging the exhibits, trophies, pictures, and artifacts during the winter and spring, looking forward to our Grand Opening the first weekend in June 2017. If you are interested in an early tour as the Museum takes shape, call Gaila Oliver (662-820-9555) or Billy Johnson (662-347-4223) Monday thru Friday between 9a & 4p. If you would like to donate funds or articles of interest, use those same numbers. Johnson is the President and Oliver is the Secretary & Treasurer of the MWHM Foundation. Both are authors of popular Outdoor Books which will be available through the Gift Shop at the Museum or on-line.

Guests are advised to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines while traveling and visiting our museum. Tour the Museum Witness the story of a music icon He started life as Riley B. King in one of America’s most impoverished places, the Mississippi Delta. He had little but the dream in his heart and a destiny that would take him around the world. Because of his international fame, music lovers from every part of the globe beg for more about the man who became B.B. King. The B.B. King Museum and Delta Interpretive Center tells the story of King’s life, his career, and stories of the Delta—its history and music, social mores and race relations, literature and legends, adversities and successes. You’ll find it in B.B.’s hometown of Indianola, which sits squarely in the middle of the Mississippi Delta, the land that gave birth to American music. Tourin' the Delta with the King Let us guide you to through the hometown of the “King of the Blues” and beyond. Begin at our Museum and let us take you on a journey for remembering. Download the Indianola Brochure The Blues was Born B.B.’s First Guitar Visitor Testimonials So worth the drive. We really enjoyed the history of B.B. King. Betty Dawn If you are or were a pro musician or music fan, allow 2+ hours to simply walk thru, read & listen to these great exhibits. Outstanding music museum! Aaron Zornes What a heck of an amazing place this is! I was totally overwhelmed with the vast amount of memorabilia and items from B.B. King’s iconic history. I highly recommend this place and that you allow sufficient time to see all of the exhibits. Debbie Saylse Well worth the ride! The facility is modern and clean and the staff could not be more friendly. They take the visitor from childhood to superstar and everywhere in between using mementos from every aspect of B.B.’s life and just as he was. The museum feels as though he were there. Cedric Floyd He Made His Mark Along the way to becoming an international icon, B.B. had heeded his mother’s advice. He treated the people he encountered with honesty, civility, and compassion. And the work ethic he learned in his youth guided the businesslike management practices he applied to his large traveling entourage. As you roam through the Museum exhibition and collection, you will see how well these philosophies repaid him, and how much this man from the Delta has contributed to American culture. *** Accolades In The News 30 10, 2025 Megan Slaughter 2025-10-30T17:22:23+00:00 Visitor Survey Thank you, visitors!

The mounds at Winterville were hand built by people that thrived in this area from about AD 1000 to 1450. Winterville served as a communal space- not just ceremonial, but a place to gather, trade, and celebrate. Twelve of the original 23 mounds and two large plazas are still intact today. Since 2000 the Mississippi Department of Archives and History has administered this significant cultural site. MDAH actively engages in consultation with the federally recognized Native American Tribes with ancestral ties to Mississippi. We ask that visitors conduct themselves respectfully while in this sacred place and that you do not walk on any of the mounds. Artist reconstruction of Winterville Mounds circa 1250 About Archaeological evidence indicates that the Native Americans who used the Winterville Mounds were most likely ancestral to the Natchez people, a tribe documented by French explorers and settlers in the early 1700s near the modern-day city that bears their name. The primary accounts written by these colonists, including Natchez lifestyles and the activities that happened at their ceremonial mound centers, lead many scholars to label them as the “last of mound builders” and “last of the Mississippian chiefdom.” Mound building was a community activity. As such, massive amounts of labor were needed to construct these mounds, plazas, and other earthworks. All of the work was done by hand- community members dug the soil and loaded it into baskets, then carried the baskets to the site, dumped it out, and tamped it down. This process was repeated until the desired shape and height of the mound was reached. Over the years, each mound was enlarged several times after its initial construction using this method. Mound maintenance would have been an important part of community life, and the mounds would have looked much different than the grassy hills seen today. Evidence recovered during archaeological investigations in 2016-2017 indicates that Mound A was covered with clay, which would have kept the summit clean and prevented erosion. It seems to have been common practice to burn any structure at its summit before enlarging a mound and then building another structure when new construction was completed. These sites served as community centers with temples and houses for chiefs placed atop the mounds. The civic and religious leaders, often ordained through matrilineal kinship, lived at these mound sites while most of the population lived at family farmsteads dispersed across the area. People from the surrounding areas would travel to and congregate at the site for special events, feasts, and ceremonial activities. A great fire during the late 1300s consumed the original building on the Temple Mound (Mound A) at Winterville, according to archaeological evidence. The cause of the fire remains a mystery. The site continued to be used afterwards, but no more mounds were built or maintained. While the site continued to be occupied after the fire, the general population declined at Winterville while increasing at settlements and mound sites 50 miles to the south, in the lower Yazoo River basin. By AD 1450, Winterville Mounds appears to have been abandoned completely. To learn more about Winterville Mounds, download Archaeological Report No. 23 . Reconstruction of Mound A At 55 feet, Mound A is among the ten tallest earthen structures in the United States. This platform-type mound is often called a Temple Mound because it would have supported a structure serving as a space for religious ceremonies. Mound A also provided a vantage point from which to view the entire site and surrounding area, including the Mississippi River approximately one mile to the west at the time mound construction began. Since Winterville was an active plantation and later a tenant farm, agricultural practices such as plowing and livestock grazing severely affected the site prior to its conversion to a state park. By the early 1930’s, Mound A’s size had been reduced significantly, and the ramp had been almost completely erased. Fearing for its future, the Greenville Garden Club raised funding to purchase the 42—acre tract, and then donated the land to the State Park commission (now Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks) in 1960. An original effort to repair the erosion was completed in 1968. Since 2016, heavy rainfall, wind, and tornadoes have periodically caused significant erosion to Mound A. In 2021, the Mississippi Department of Archives and History (MDAH), in collaboration with FEMA and the MDAH federally recognized Tribal partners, began an effort to stabilize the mound and restore it to its original condition. This collaboration undertook many phases of design, engineering, and review to ensure it met the needs of all parties. This included a variety of investigation methods for both the mound and surrounding plaza to ensure no harm came to archaeological resources during construction. For example, prior to defining the construction area limits, MDAH had ground-penetrating radar performed around the mound to detect any subsurface structures. Additionally, MDAH archaeology staff completed limited testing of the mound fill with small soil probes to determine the thickness of the 1968 fill. Both of these methods allowed MDAH, FEMA, and Tribes to work with an engineer to develop a methodology that protected the original mound fill. Construction crews removed only the top few inches of sod to provide a clean surface, and then sterile fill was placed around that surface, similar to putting on a protective coat. Construction included recreation of the ramp, although regulations necessitated it being slightly larger than its original design. Final construction phases included removal of protective matting that was placed to prevent damage to the surrounding plaza and was completed in October 2024. Additional Mounds at Winterville Map of Winterville Mounds from 1860 Although Mound A is certainly the most prominent, originally Winterville contained at least 22 additional mounds according to available maps and personal accounts. Many of these were located in the agricultural fields surrounding the site and have been lost to erosion and agricultural practices. However, several of the original mounds were saved and are being preserved. At about 30 feet high, Mound B is the second-tallest mound at Winterville and sits at the southwest end of the mound group. It has also proven to be one of the richest sources for information over the last hundred years. It was constructed in multiple stages and exhibits evidence of burned structures. Mound B was connected to many of the other mounds via a causeway, which is simply a raised walkway. Mound C forms an oval shape in layout, rather than the more commonly found round or quadrilateral shape. The mound’s present shape is due to slumping and erosion. The discovery of a trash pile, called a midden, and structural remains including wall trenches with repeated burning points to its usage through Winterville’s history. Mound D sits along the western border of the site and was constructed on an earlier, pre-mound occupation deposit dating to the end of the Coles Creek period (AD 1000–1200). In 2007, University of Southern Mississippi excavations uncovered a trash-filled pit near Mound D containing layers of animal bone (squirrel, rabbit, waterfowl, and other birds) and broken pottery that date to ca. AD 1200. The pit may have been excavated to provide materials to form Mound D, and the layers of trash may represent feasts associated with its construction. Mound F functioned as a platform for a structure, likely a house. Excavations in 1967-1968 indicate that it was constructed in a single event rather than over time. Recent archaeological discoveries about the history of Winterville Mounds include the confirmation that a causeway existed between Mound A and F, originally depicted in a map of the site from 1860. Causeways have been identified between other mounds at Winterville, but Mound F appears to be significant as it is the only one connected to the Temple Mound. Mound E has been largely lost to erosion but is barely visible on the landscape. Additionally, Mounds G, H, I, and J are heavily eroded, with Mounds I and J barely visible along the property line. Little archaeological work has been completed on these mounds, but 1969 work by Jeffrey Brain on Mound G has indicated that this mound played a role in mortuary practices at Winterville. There is archaeological evidence that structures were present on Mound K at different times. It was common to burn one structure, add to the earthen mound, and build another structure on the newly made surface. Few artifacts were found which suggests that the first structure was purposefully cleared prior to being destroyed. Finally, Mound L has been greatly impacted by agricultural practices and is slightly visible on the southern property line. In addition to the mounds, the plazas also played a key role in the Winterville site. A plaza, in archaeology terms, is simply an empty area between mounds or mound groupings. Winterville is considered to have two main plazas, the space between Mounds A and B, and the exterior area outside Mounds F-I. Excavations by the University of Southern Mississippi revealed that this second plaza contained a sizeable midden and evidence of feasting, indicating a thriving seasonal population visited this significant site.

    "homepage_content":"The Civil War in Polk County - Tennessee Civil War Preservation Association News The Civil War in Polk County In Polk County, nestled in the southern Appalachian Mountains, a site and stories mark the vast extent of violence during the Civil War. Unlike most other eastern Tennessee counties all military units in the Civil War raised in Polk County were Confederate. The most well-known event was the 1864 “Polk County Murders” or the “Madden Branch Massacre” – when rebel forces under command of Kentuckian Captain Gatewood attacked and raided numerous local citizens – killing as many as 27 citizens. The killing and raiding extended from the Conasauga River to Benton to Greasy Creek to the Ocoee River. (AT RIGHT: Commemorative sign marks the southern edge of the Memorial Forest along US Highway 64 at Boyd’s Gap, east of the Whitewater Center.) The story as reported in the Official Records reveals that victims and members of the raiding forces were from Bradley and Polk Counties – a story that underscores the deep divide of brothers against brothers during the Civil War. “Bryant Coxey, after having served in the rebel army, got out, has taken the oath, and is protected at home, while his son is killing his neighbors.” (Coxley’s son, from the local area, assisted in the1864 murders and robberies- Tennessee Civil War Sourcebook) A memorial atop Chilhowee Mountain tells the story of a Feb. 15, 1865 skirmish. Union soldiers, pursuing Confederate bushwhackers, attacked while the Confederates camped atop Chilhowee Mountain. At least one Confederate soldier was killed. Today chiseled stones mark the campsite: “T.B. Haney A Confederate Soldier Was Killed Here Feb.15, 1865 Soldiers Campsite, Feb. 15, 1865 Capten P.O. Bible • Lieutenant P.L. Bible • Lieutenant A.D. Donaldson Tom Haney killed W.M. Crockets Leg Shot Crawled to Grassey Creek Jasper McConnell George Renfro captured Co B 62th Tenn. C.S.A. The Confederate Memorial Forest At the onset of World War II, the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) in cooperation with the U.S. Forest Service commemorated the sacrifice of Tennessee Confederate soldiers by creating a living memorial in the Cherokee National Forest. According to local historians, the Civilian Conservation Corps planted the seedlings provided by the UDC. The “Memorial Forest” was a more than 100 acre tract of land dedicated in 1942 to the 115,000 Tennessee “boys in grey.” Trees were planted in an area in need of reclamation – in memory of each “gallant son, and it will also demonstrate that we are working in these war times for flood control, reforestation, to correct soil erosion and the preservation of bird life.” (Minutes, 49th Annual Convention, United Daughters of the Confederacy) US Highway 64, once bisecting the memorial forest, is now located along the south side of the Memorial Forest. While a sign along Highway 64 marks the Memorial Forest, the Southern Pine Beetle has destroyed many of the trees planted in the 1940s. Note: Another UDC “Confederate Memorial Forest” was set aside in western North Carolina in 1940 in the Pisgah National Forest. At the same time, other living forest memorials were reportedly either established or contemplated in Kentucky and northeastern Tennessee.

The site functioned in some smaller capacity through December 1811. The Tellico Blockhouse served as a check against white encroachment as those of European decent were required to have written passes from the commander of the Blockhouse before entering deeper into Cherokee land. This site was also home to the Tellico Factory, part of Henry Knox’s civilizing policy and its aim of teaching modern methods of agriculture and industry to the American Indian. As a trading post, the Tellico Blockhouse offered trade items for hides. Furs and hides were the primary currency that the Cherokee could barter with. Through years of such trade the fur-bearing animals of the region were decimated. This trade had an economic and environmental impact on the area. The Tellico Factory offered a solution when spinning wheels, cotton seed, looms, and training were brought to the Cherokee at the Tellico Blockhouse. Much of the Little Tennessee River Valley was planted in cotton. This new commodity took some of the stress off of fur bearing animals and provided the Cherokee with a valued item of trade. The Tellico Blockhouse was in use during a time when the future of the United States was uncertain. Spain controlled the Mississippi River, the port city of New Orleans, and had built a fort where Memphis now stands. At times, Spain and the United States seemed close to war. The young U.S. Army had suffered devastating losses at the hands of American Indian confederations. The United States could not face both American Indian and Spanish forces. Through establishments such as the Tellico Blockhouse better relations were fostered between the U.S. and many American Indian cultures. The Cherokee people and the U.S. citizens could remember recent atrocities. This garrison of American soldiers was a symbol of military power but also of the government’s intent to keep order. No longer would roaming militias and bands of Cherokee repay violence for violence. Negotiations would take the place of violence. Much of what is now known as Tennessee was signed over by the Cherokee at the Blockhouse. By 1807 few Cherokee remained in the Little Tennessee River Valley. The Blockhouse was no longer a convenient place for them to meet. The garrison was relocated down along the Hiwassee where many of the Cherokee had moved. A few soldiers did remain at the Blockhouse through December 1811 but official functions were taking place elsewhere. Today the Tellico Blockhouse is in a state of stabilized ruin. Visitors can walk the ground once walked by the Cherokee, soldiers, and agents of government. The site is part of Fort Loudoun State Historic Area and is a day use area. This establishment, spurred by the governor of the Territory Southwest of the River Ohio, is now overseen by the State of Tennessee. Download PDF Go to Top",

Someone will get back to you FAST With the help of a restoration grant from the New Jersey Historic Trust, CHABA is assisting the City of Bridgeton in preserving the ' Nail House '--surviving home of the former Cumberland Nail & Iron Works, set directly at the entrance to Bridgeton City Park , and among the earliest industrial ventures in South Jersey. This remnant of Bridgeton's former industrial might is one of the region's most storied places, holding the remarkable hidden history of its relationship to that green resource of the park. ​ It has an important story for us now , and a story we want it to go on telling. With restoration support from City, County and State--and the ongoing personal contributions of the people of Bridgeton and surrounding communities, CHABA also promotes the Nail House's educational use, providing tours for school children of every grade, and support for history and environmental programs at the college level. Defying the setbacks of the pandemic, our nearly-completed repairs have already enabled this little building to be a hub of social and cultural activity again, and return to life as the ceremonial entrance to one of the largest urban parks in the state. ​ Look for our heavily-illustrated intergenerational children's book, \"This little building is huge .\" Already a State-award-winning as well as local classic, it tells the 200-year \"grunge to green\" story of the Nail House in colorful down-to-earth language, and is available in both English and Spanish! \"CHABA brings people together and makes our community stronger AND more beautiful! I'm proud to support their mission\" - Nadia Albizu Bridgeton is named for the tiny bridge that has straddled the Cohansey River here since 1716, and has been the seat of New Jersey’s rural Cumberland County and the hub of its commercial activity since before the Revolution. Steeped in a marinade of pre-colonial, colonial, and postcolonial histories and cultures, layer on layer, its culture has flavored the South Jersey region for centuries. A premier example of an Arts & Crafts home on Bridgeton's west side. Scenic view of the Cohansey River flowing through Bridgeton, NJ. The large historic district, with over 2,000 individual properties spanning three centuries, has an encyclopedic architectural range -- from cabin to castle, high Victorian to classical revival to modernist. It also includes an amazing number of individual architectural gems, many designed by noted architects. ​ CHABA has been collaborating with the City of Bridgeton and the New Jersey Historic Trust to make essential repairs to the 1815 first home to the Cumberland Nail & Iron Works, a 'founder site' that helped launch Bridgeton as an industrial powerhouse. Now--In this post -industrial era, we are not only making it accessible and usable again, but telling its stories--of ironmasters and ironworkers, of course--but also of its 'grunge to green' transformation in the 20th century into a resource for recreation and culture at the very entrance to Bridgeton City Park. We know we can reclaim and 'adaptively reuse' historic places in the social and cultural life of our communities, and not just keep them alive but make them beacons of environmental practice for the future. ​ A flyer for a 'maker' event at the Nail House. The Nail House is conveniently located on the edge of the Downtown AND at the entrance to Bridgeton City Park-- both popular community destinations To play, press and hold the enter key. To stop, release the enter key. Together, we can ensure that Bridgeton's rich history and culture are not just preserved, but made valuable, visible, useful and sustainable for generations to come.

    "homepage_content":"Granbury’s Lunette | The Battle of Nashville Trust ↓ Home Menu ↓ Skip to primary content Skip to secondary content On December 15, 1864, the Confederate line was anchored on the far right by Granbury’s Lunette. The lunette, a name given to earthen field fortifications which originated in the 17 th Century as crescent-shaped outworks, was named after Gen. Hiram B. Granbury, who was killed during the battle of Franklin a couple of weeks earlier. Manning the Confederate right was the Corps of Gen. Benjamin Franklin Cheatham, a Nashvillian who himself happened to be in the lunette on the morning of Dec. 15. The lunette contained 4 artillery pieces and the remaining 344 men of Granbury’s Brigade. On this first day of battle, Union Gen. George Thomas sent Maj. Gen. James Steedman’s corps against the Confederate right as a feint; the major thrust of the Union attack would come on the far end of the Confederate line, about four miles to the west, with a huge wheeling maneuver by infantry and cavalry. Steedman’s forces chosen for this assignment involved three brigades. Two of them were regiments of the United States Colored Troops (USCT), consisting of African-American soldiers, many of whom were seeing their first combat since the first recruitment of black troops in 1863. The 1st Colored Brigade consisting of five USCT regiments (14 th , 16 th , 17 th , 18 th and 44 th ) was commanded by Col. Thomas Jefferson Morgan; the 2nd Colored Brigade, consisting of three USCT regiments (12 th , 13 th and 100 th ), was commanded by Col. Charles Thompson. The third brigade was commanded by Lt. Col. Charles Grosvenor and was composed of an eclectic assortment of white soldiers whom he described as “new conscripts, convalescents, and bounty-jumpers.” The attacking force totaled about 7,000 infantry and supporting batteries. Above: Remains of Lunette works, looking south, with “new” railroad cut to left. Heavy fog enveloped the lunette area when Steedman’s three brigades finally got underway, attempting to flank the Confederate forces from the East in the vicinity of the Murfreesboro Pike. The first advance toward the area of the lunette came from the 1st Colored Brigade. The Southerners were well aware of the advance and allowed the Union troops to penetrate to within extremely close range before unleashing a devastating barrage of rifle fire and canister shot from the four guns within the lunette. One part of the 1 st Brigade had advanced south of the lunette and did not realize they were approaching a deep depression in which lay the tracks of the Nashville & Chattanooga railroad. A horrendous scene unfolded as Cheatham’s troops allowed the Union troops to advance into an inescapable position. When the Confederates sprang their trap, many of the Union soldiers jumped down into the railroad cut. Others had already begun to move into the cut at its far southern opening. Many reports document the broken bones and other injuries resulting from the jump, and of the withering fusillade of fire from Cheatham’s Corps who were poised on the top rims of the railroad cut. The Union brigades suffered significant casualties. Most reports indicate that hundreds of black soldiers were killed in the fight. Photo above shows the area of the railroad “cut” where U.S.C.T. troops took heavy casualties from Cheatham’s Corps. The depth of the cut shown in this 2011 photo is deeper by about 10 feet than on the day of the battle, due to a grade change by the railroad at the time it laid the “cut-off” tracks adjacent to the Lunette in the early 1900s. The 2 nd Brigade, approaching from the North, had become locked into a duel with Confederate forces and stayed that way most of the day. Grosvenor’s brigade was quickly routed after Cheatham’s Corps had dispatched the 1 st Brigade at the lunette and railroad cut. The battle around Granbury’s Lunette was the only Confederate victory on the first day of the Battle of Nashville. The left flank collapsed late in the afternoon as the overwhelming strength of the Union forces was brought to bear. Cheatham’s corps eventually abandoned the lunette and withdrew with the remainder of the Confederate line around 9:00 p.m. They re-formed throughout the night for the second and final day of the battle on December 16, 1864. It is difficult to record the full meaning of the Battle of the Lunette without recognizing how it was impacted by the relatively rare occurrence of the racial make-up of the combatants. The “Colored Brigades” were heavily represented by former slaves seeing their first combat, while most of their all-white opponents were also seeing black Union soldiers for the first time. That scenario played itself out again the next day in the fierce battle at Peach Orchard Hill. In both encounters, great courage was displayed by both sides. Above: Remains of Lunette earthen wall, looking north (“new” railroad cut to right) Long after the Battle of Nashville, Granbury’s Lunette was partially destroyed when a second railroad bed was cut through part of it in the 20 th Century. Its remnants – officially located at 190 Polk Avenue — were salvaged by, and are owned by, the Gen. Joseph E. Johnston Camp of the SCV. The preservation was assisted by adjacent McCord Crane Co. Evidence of its earth walls and the infantry ditch that fronted the wall can still be seen. The deadly railroad cut lies about 400 feet West of the lunette, which stands as one of the most important preserved sites of the battlefield. For a detailed account of this part of the Battle of Nashville, see James Lee McDonough’s excellent book, Nashville – The Western Confederacy’s Final Gamble (2004) October, 2021 FIRST HISTORICAL MARKER RECOGNIZING THE ROLE OF BLACK TROOPS IN THE BATTLE OF NASHVILLE HAS BEEN ERECTED NEAR GRANBURY’S LUNETTE The African American troops of the Union army gained formal, public recognition on Oct. 15, 2021, when the Metro (Nashville) Historical Commission erected a marker near Granbury’s Lunette, some 157 years after they clashed on that ground with Confederate troops during the Battle of Nashville. The marker is the first-ever commemoration of the important and unique role played by African-American troops in the Battle of Nashville. Other markers will follow, including two already in the advanced planning stages by the Battle of Nashville Trust . Workers install USCT marker on Polk Avenue. Photo by Clay Bailey Some 7,000 Union soldiers consisting mostly of United States Colored Troops (USCT) attacked Confederate forces at the Lunette during the foggy morning hours of Dec. 15, 1864, the opening salvos of the Battle of Nashville. The Lunette, a crescent shaped earthwork manned by about 340 Confederate soldiers, was anchoring the far right flank of the Confederate line. The two brigades of Black troops, many of them former slaves, had virtually no combat experience. The First Brigade, consisting of five regiments (14 th , 16 th , 17 th , 18 th and 44 th ) and led by Col. Thomas Morgan, was decimated by Confederate troops after they were led into an untenable position that left them exposed to Confederate fire, with devastating consequences. To review more details about the battle at the Lunette and the Confederate right flank, visit the Granbury’s Lunette page on this website. The historical marker had been in development for years with the work spearheaded by USCT descendant and reenactor Gary Burke, whose great-great-grandfather had been among the USCT ranks on that 1864 morning. His ancestor, Pvt. Peter Bailey, served in the First Brigade, Co. K, 17 th USCT Regiment. The marker was placed on Polk Avenue at the intersection of Fiber Glass Road, within sight of the preserved remnants of Granbury’s Lunette. The Lunette is owned and maintained by the Gen. Joseph E. Johnston Camp of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. The USCT marker reads: BATTLE OF NASHVILLE Attack By US Colored Troops On The Confederate Right Flank After defeating the Confederate army at Franklin, Union troops under Gen. John Schofield returned to Nashville. Confederate troops under Gen. John Bell Hood followed, and spent 2 weeks preparing to assault the capital. The Confederate line was anchored by Granbury’s Lunette, an earthworks fortification with four artillery pieces and 344 men under the command of Gen. Benjamin Cheatham. Early on Dec. 15, 1864, three brigades under Maj. Gen. James Steedman attacked the lunette. Reenactors Bill Radcliffe, Norman Hill and Gary Burke pose at the marker with Jessica Reeves. Photo by Clay Bailey. At the ceremonial installation of the marker, Gary Burke was joined by other USCT reenactors, including Bill Radcliffe and Norman Hill, all dressed in their U.S. Army blue uniforms. “It took 157 years to finally get this marker to fruition,” Burke told the assembled crowd. The three USCT reenactors ended the program by singing the African American anthem “Oh, Freedom” acapella. Burke mentioned numerous others involved in realization of the marker, including Jessica Reeves, coordinator of the Historical Markers Program for the Metro (Nashville) Historical Commission, along with two other Metro Historical Commissioners: Linda Wynn, a Fisk University history instructor and staff of the Tennessee Historical Commission, and Clay Bailey, a BONT board member and head of the history department at Montgomery Bell Academy; and Learotha Williams Jr., Metro Historic Zoning Commissioner and professor of African American history at Tennessee State University. Jim Kay, president of the Battle of Nashville Trust, pointed out that prior to this USCT assault, officers in both Union and Confederate forces questioned whether Black troops would “stand and fight” in military combat. That myth vanished after the two USCT brigades displayed their courage and commitment at Granbury’s Lunette and again on Dec. 16, 1864, in the brutal assault up Peach Orchard Hill, after which officers of both armies commended their valor in the field of battle. Kay credited the persistence of USCT descendants, especially Gary Burke, for bringing the long-overdue historical recognition to reality. “His efforts were monumental here. This has been a long-time dream of his and much of this credit goes to him and him alone,” Kay said. The Battle of Nashville Trust has secured grants from the Tennessee Wars Commission to place two interpretative markers explaining the USCT’s involvement in the Battle of Nashville. One is planned for the Peach Orchard Hill area, site of one of the bloodiest conflicts of the two-day battle of Nashville. The site under consideration is the north slope of the hill where two USCT brigades distinguished themselves on the afternoon of Dec. 16, 1864. The other will be in the Granbury‘s Lunette area, near the railroad cut. The markers will be placed in conjunction with Civil War Trails, and are designed to interpret the historical action that occurred near the site of the signage. Civil War Trails signs are currently located in over 1,200 sites. The Battle of Nashville Trust ↑",

Your experienced tour guide, Larry DeBerry has lived in Shiloh all his life and walked the battlefield hundreds of times. His great-great-grandfather (who helped build the log church in 1851) was a victim of a stray bullet on the first day of the fight and the only civilian killed in the battle. A lifetime student of the Battle of Shiloh, and an authentic Civil War re-enactor, Larry helps you uncover history with interesting discussions about each side’s successes and failures as well as the impact of the war between the states. Larry Deberry at Shiloh Log Church Larry Deberry at Pittsburg Landing Quick Facts: Set in the western theater of the Civil War (1861-65), nearly 110,000 Union and Confederate soldiers clashed in a bloody contest around Shiloh Church and Pittsburg Landing . Deemed the largest engagement in the Mississippi Valley , the two-day struggle between the Union forces and rebels on April 6 and 7, 1862 resulted in more than 23,000 casualties. Retrace the steps of the two armies: from General Albert Sidney Johnston’s (Confederate) surprise attack on General Ulysses S. Grant's troops stationed around the log church to the bitter fighting that raged across Shiloh Hill, the Peach Orchard, Water Oaks Pond, Hornet's Nest, Grant’s Last Line and finally ending at Pittsburg Landing. Established in December 27, 1894, Shiloh National Military Park is one of the best preserved Civil War battlefields in America. The largest display of artifacts and relics at the Shiloh Tours’ Civil War Museum pays homage to the brave soldiers and is a grim reminder of the effects of war. “I would just like to say what a joy it was to go with Larry on a history tour of the Shiloh National Battlefield. Larry is informed in every aspect of the battle” Dee, Corinth MS Larry Deberry at the Shiloh Bloody Pond Learn about all these interesting facts as you stop at landmark sites during your guided tour of Shiloh Park . We offer tours to cover the battlefield’s wide array of historical landmarks while following the chronological timeline of events. We are very grateful to the Park Service staff. We recognize their tireless efforts and all the work they do in order to preserve the natural beauty and historical integrity of the Park. For over 20 years, Shiloh Tours has been helping individuals, families, schools, church groups and other interested organizations see and understand the impact of the Battle of Shiloh on the soldiers and our nation.

Whether you are an architecture buff or tourist-in-your-own-town, you will be part of a shared experience with lots of room for individual curiosity. ​ Enjoy lots of: ​ Storytelling Close looking Exploration Connection About The Houses Book Your Tour About the Zimmerman House ​ The Zimmerman House was commissioned by Isadore and Lucille Zimmerman in 1949. The two-bedroom home embodies Wright’s Usonian architectural concepts. The compact design contrasts narrow passages with dramatic, open spaces that blend different functions, in a manner which predicts today’s open-plan homes. The house is constructed of brick and Georgia cypress, and retains its original furniture and garden, both designed by Wright. About the Kalil House ​ Designed in 1955, the Kalil House is one of only seven Usonian Automatics ever constructed. Wright termed the style “automatic” because they were intended to be easily and quickly built. Toufic and Mildred Kalil were inspired to commission the house by their close friends and neighbors Isadore and Lucille Zimmerman, who had commissioned a Wright house a few years earlier on the same street.

Built in 1797 of locally sourced pink marble and blue limestone, Ramsey House was indeed known as the “finest house in Tennessee”. Because of its architectural sophistication and relative opulence, Ramsey House welcomed many diplomats and important guests through its doors. Once considered an anomaly among log cabins and wooden structures, the house stands today as a reminder of the enduring Ramsey Family Legacy. The foundational contributions of Colonel Ramsey and his sons are significant, and include founding trustee of the institution that would become the University of Tennessee, Tennessee’s premier historian, and first popularly elected Mayor of Knoxville. Through the Ramsey’s story, you will also experience daily life on America’s first frontier and come to know the challenges faced by the sons and daughters of the Revolutionary War patriots. You will learn about the enslaved people whose lives were intertwined with those of the family, as well as, feel the deep divisions of the Civil War, which changed the course of this family forever.

About The Natchez Indians and their ancestors inhabited what is now southwest Mississippi ca. AD 700-1730. According to historical and archaeological evidence, the Grand Village was their main ceremonial center between 1682 and 1730. French explorers, priests, and journalists described the ceremonial mounds built by the Natchez on the banks of St. Catherine Creek. Later archaeological investigations produced additional evidence that the site was the place that the French called \"the Grand Village of the Natchez.\" During the height of power at the Grand Village, the French explored the region and began to make settlements. Relations between the French and the Natchez were cordial at first, but deteriorated as various disagreements and episodes of violence arose in 1716 and again in 1723. In 1729, a pro-English element within the nation led the Natchez to attack the French colonial plantations and military garrison at Fort Rosalie. The French retaliated in such force that the Natchez were forced to abandon their homeland. Read more about the history of the Natchez Indians Two of the mounds, the Great Sun’s Mound and the Temple Mound, have been excavated and rebuilt to their original sizes and shapes. A religious structure once stood atop the Temple Mound. A sacred perpetual fire was kept in the Temple’s inner sanctum, symbolic of the sun from which the royal family had descended.

The Lotz House Museum. Unforgettable… -Dennis Ferrier Went to the Lotz house with my parents and partner and enjoyed a wonderful tour led by Evan. Evan was friendly, informative, charismatic and brought the stories of the Lotz family and the Battle of Franklin to life. A true gem in Franklin and well worth a visit for tourists and local history buffs alike. -Josh R Chuck was our tour guide. His passion for the history of the Franklin battle and his detailed explanation of how the Lotz House and family was dead center of the conflict was brought to life with great stories and full of character. I wish I had him as my high school history teacher, I might have paid attention. Thank you sir. -Aidan B We’ve gone on many tours of historical houses and the tour of the Lotz House ranks with the best! The story of the house, which is located on a Civil War battlefield, is fascinating as is the story of the master craftsman who built it and the family that lived there. The house is filled with thousands of artifacts retrieved from the battlefield, plus furniture and other articles from this house and others of the period. Our tour guide, Will, was friendly and knowledgeable and offered a short history lesson of the battle, the house and the people who lived there. While many house tours require visitors to stand behind ropes while viewing the rooms, this tour allow visitors to enter and browse every room. Tours begin on the hour and, in our opinion, are a “must see” in Franklin. -Hal W Being a relative newcomer to Tennessee, I wasn’t sure what a “Lotz House” was, but I’m very glad that I gave it a look-see. In a very informative 45+ minute tour of the house, I learned about the Battle of Franklin, the German immigrant master craftsman who built the house, and his extraordinary family – including his daughter Matilda – a world-renowned painter of animal life. Thanks to Will and Thomas! -Alan C We went on a Lotz House tour that focused on womens’ history – both locally and nationally during the Civil War era. It was incredible, and we all loved our tour guide, Kelly Kautzman. She was full of knowledge and enthusiasm. She immediately got a feel for our interests, and aligned her information and presentation based on that. The house is beautifully restored and preserved, and the story behind it is fascinating, as is much of Franklin’s rich Civil War era history. -Cindy Wow! I love when guides are passionate about their history! Thomas was one of the best tour guides if not the best we have ever had on a tour! He knew all his information plus extra! We learned so much! Make sure to take a tour of the Lotz house if you are ever in Franklin! -Debbie A We visited this week and were surprised to get a tour just by ourselves with Thomas, their resident Civil War expert. He shared the history of the house and the Lotz family, but he also answered all the our questions about the house and the battle. It was really great. I had an ancestor who fought at the Battle of Franklin and he told me facts about the company and where they fought and the details of the battle. Amazing.

Johann was a master woodworker and used the Lotz house as a showroom for his successful business. On the eve of the battle, Johann took his family across the street to the safety of the brick Carter House. While they survived the night, the family couldn’t fully recover after the war and were forced to head west. Eventually, the daughter, Matilda Lotz, would become a talented artist. More than a dozen of her original pieces still hang in the Lotz House in Franklin TN.

The Fairbanks House in Dedham, MA is the oldest known timber frame house still standing in North America. Built circa 1637 for Jonathan and Grace Fairbanks and their six children, it was home to eight generations of the Fairbanks family over the course of 269 years. The Fairbanks House is now a historic house museum and on the National Register of Historic Places. ~ Like No Other Historic House ~ Abbott Lowell Cummings, former Charles F. Montgomery Professor of American Decorative Arts at Yale University, said that the Fairbanks House... \"is one of the most important historic houses now standing in the northeastern part of the United States. Its value to the area and to the nation as a whole lies not so much in its claim to being the oldest house in New England but in its architectural significanceâ¦ It may be said quite simply that no other house of the mid-17th century in New England has survived in such unbelievable unspoiled condition. It is extraordinary that so early a structure should preserve such a high percentage of original features. It is a veritable storehouse of information concerning the small handful of houses which survive from this early period. \"\u0003 LEARN MORE Get Involved!

In 1735, John Adams was born in the \"salt box\" house located only 75 feet away from the birthplace of his son John Quincy Adams. In the John Quincy Adams Birthplace, young John and his bride Abigail started their family and the future President launched his career in politics and law. John Adams maintained his law office in the house and it was here that he, Samuel Adams, and James Bowdoin wrote the Massachusetts Constitution. This document, still in use today, greatly influenced development of the United States Constitution. Old House at Peace field NPS Photo The Old House at Peace field , built in 1731, became the residence of the Adams family for four generations from 1788 to 1927. It was home to Presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams; First Ladies Abigail and Louisa Catherine Adams; Civil War Minister to Great Britain Charles Francis Adams; and literary historians Henry and Brooks Adams. The vast collection of original artifacts inside the Old House greatly assists the park's interpretive staff to relate the Adams family's legacy of service to their nation. Adjacent to the house is the Stone Library, built in 1873, it contains more than 12,000 books that belonged to the Adamses. Following a tour, you may wish to stroll the Old House grounds which include a historic orchard and an 18th-century style formal garden, containing thousands of annual and perennial flowers. Inside view of the Stone Library NPS Photo The Stone Library is home to over 12,000 volumes, reflecting the literary tastes and interests of four generations of Adams men and women, beginning with John Adams in 1768. Today, about 10% of the books belonged to the second U.S. President, John Adams. the greater part of the remainder belonged to his son, sixth U.S. President, John Quincy Adams. In his will, John Quincy Adams requested that a fireproof structure be constructed separate from the house for the proper use of his books, papers and maps. In 1870, his son, Charles Francis Adams succeeded in fulfilling his father's wishes with the construction of the medieval style Stone Library. His sons and grandsons all used the library for writing. Charles Francis Adams worked on the ten volume, Diary of John Adams , the twelve volume, The Memoirs of John Quincy Adams , and The Letters of Abigail Adams . His son, Henry Adams worked on his, History of the United States , writing to friend John Hay, I write history as though it were serious, five hours a day; and when my hand and head get tired, I step out in the rose-beds and watch my favorite roses.. . I give and bequesth my library of books, my manuscript books and papers, and those of my father, and all of my family pictures...to my son, Charles Francis Adams, trusting that his mother shall at all times have the use of any of the books in the library at her discretions; and I recommend to my said son...to cause a building to be erected, made fire-proof, in which to keep the said library, books, documents, and manuscripts safe...and I especially recommend ...that he will, as far as may be in his power, keep them together as one library... Will of John Quincy Adams, January 18, 1847 The John Adams Library at the Boston Public Library John Adams had a life long passion for books and spent a lifetime collecting some 3,000 volumes. With the exception of Abigail's fictional works and a few that I shall reserve for my consolation in the few days that remain to me , he deeded his library, for public good, to the City of Quincy. After 75 years, and six different locations within Quincy, the library was transferred to the Boston Public Library in 1894, where it remains to this day in the Rare Books Collection . For questions regarding the library collection in the Stone Library, contact Adams National Historical Park at ADAM_Visitor_Center@nps.gov.

CITATION The Battle of Anzio Italy For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at risk of life above and beyond the call of duty. Pvt. Mills, undergoing his baptism of fire, preceded his platoon down a draw to reach a position from which an attack could be launched against a heavily fortified strongpoint. After advancing about 300 yards, Pvt. Mills was fired on by a machinegun only 5 yards distant. He killed the gunner with 1 shot and forced the surrender of the assistant gunner. Continuing his advance, he saw a German soldier in a camouflaged position behind a large bush pulling the pin of a potato-masher grenade. Covering the German with his rifle, Pvt. Mills forced him to drop the grenade and captured him. When another enemy soldier attempted to throw a hand grenade into the draw, Pvt. Mills killed him with 1 shot. Brought under fire by a machinegun, 2 machine pistols, and 3 rifles at a range of only 50 feet, he charged headlong into the furious chain of automatic fire shooting his M 1 from the hip. The enemy was completely demoralized by Pvt. Mills' daring charge, and when he reached a point within 10 feet of their position, all 6 surrendered. As he neared the end of the draw, Pvt. Mills was brought under fire by a machinegunner 20 yards distant. Despite the fact that he had absolutely no cover, Pvt. Mills killed the gunner with 1 shot. Two enemy soldiers near the machinegunner fired wildly at Pvt. Mills and then fled. Pvt. Mills fired twice, killing 1 of the enemy. Continuing on to the position, he captured a fourth soldier. When it became apparent that an assault on the strongpoint would in all probability cause heavy casualties on the platoon, Pvt. Mills volunteered to cover the advance down a shallow ditch to a point within 50 yards of the objective. Standing on the bank in full view of the enemy less than 100 yards away, he shouted and fired his rifle directly into the position. His ruse worked exactly as planned. The enemy centered his fire on Pvt. Mills. Tracers passed within inches of his body, rifle and machine pistol bullets ricocheted off the rocks at his feet. Yet he stood there firing until his rifle was empty. Intent on covering the movement of his platoon, Pvt. Mills jumped into the draw, reloaded his weapon, climbed out again, and continued to lay down a base of fire. Repeating this action 4 times, he enabled his platoon to reach the designated spot undiscovered, from which position it assaulted and overwhelmed the enemy, capturing 22 Germans and taking the objective without casualties.

You are there - in Salem Village in 1692, and you are guaranteed a unique educational experience with a chill or two. You'll experience the acclaimed performance of a Witch trial adapted from the 1692 historical transcripts. Professional actresses in repertory reenact the electrifying scene. Welcome to Salem Massachusetts, where in the year 1692 something very unusual took place. The Reverend Parris' daughter Betty and Niece Abigail began acting very strangely. The minister asked Dr. Griggs to examine the girls, but he could not find anything wrong with them. Abigail and Betty continued their strange behavior and other children began to copy them. Here are some of the odd things they did: Some children would bark like a dog, others would throw themselves on the floor and have fits. One child tried to crawl into the fireplace. Another child said the Devil was after her. The adults now believed that the Devil had come to their little village. The children began to say that some of the people in the village were witches and had cast spells on them. The villagers gathered at the meeting house to find and punish the people who were bewitching the children. The children began to accuse their neighbors. They said they were witches. Fear spread through the village. The Devil had come to Salem. The trials lasted for thirteen months. One hundred and fifty-six people were accused. Nineteen were hanged. One man was pressed to death. Two dogs were hanged because the children said they gave them the \"evil eye\". T: (978) 741-3570 | 16 Lynde Street , Salem, MA 01970 | Visit All 3 Museums Find Us On Facebook",

In the eighteenth century, the plantation was home to the Royalls, the largest slaveholding family in Massachusetts, and at least sixty enslaved women, men, and children whose forced labor helped build the Royall family’s wealth. As one of the only remaining freestanding quarters where enslaved people lived and worked in the North, the museum bears witness to their lives, to the intertwined stories of wealth and bondage in pre-Revolutionary Massachusetts, and to the resistance and political and legal activism of enslaved and free Black people in the eighteenth century. The museum is open to the public for tours on weekends from June through October, while school and group tours are available from mid-March to mid-November. The museum also presents a range of public programs throughout the year. Members receive free admission to the museum and free or discounted admission to most programs. Museums Are Not Neutral As people across the world take to the streets to protest the police killings of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, George Floyd in Minneapolis, and Tony McDade in Tallahassee, we have a responsibility to speak out. We are committed to telling the history of slavery and freedom while highlighting how the legacy of enslavement creates systemic inequalities today. Thus, we stand in solidarity with the protesters bravely fighting against police violence and demanding justice, accountability, and a transformation of policies that sustain racial and economic inequalities. Our job is not only to listen, but also to uplift and amplify the history and voices of Black people locally, nationally, and globally in the struggle for freedom. Museums Are Not Neutral.

We are open most Monday and Tuesday afternoons, 1-5 pm. If these hours are not convenient for you, please email curator@harvardhistory.org, to let us know you would like to order a book. Softcover book is $35.00, hardcover is $45. The book is newly edited by Joe Theriault from a manuscript written by members of the Society in the late 1930’s, under the leadership of Ida Harris . The manuscript has been prepared for publication by Joe Theriault. The book was formerly available only in a typed manuscript compiled by Ida Harris but never formally published, perhaps because of wartime. Ida Harris tells us in her Preface that “Records have been searched, papers consulted, some of the oldest inhabitants interviewed and efforts made to obtain the most authentic information available.” She concludes “The aim of this committee has been to preserve for posterity such material as is now available but which, with the passing of the present inhabitants, might be forever lost.” The book is 459 pages long and filled with information. Sections include short biographies of citizens of the town, the apple industry, roads and transportation, electric lights, cellar holes and old home sites, education, military annals, social and political organizations, vital records for the years between 1890 and 1940, and much much more. The book is a fascinating combination of historical facts and the recollections of the contributors. The book is published by the Harvard Historical Society and all proceeds from the sale of the book will benefit the Society.

    "homepage_content":"Carrabelle History Museum – Preserving the History and Culture of Carrabelle, Florida Skip to content WELCOME We opened in April of 2009, and since then, residents of the community have generously shared their pictures, genealogy, memories, household and work items to build our collection. Our first artifact was the medical bag of beloved midwife Tillie Miller, donated by Rita Brown Millender and John Brown. From then Carrabelle History Museum has grown to house thousands of items in its collections. Gratefully, we still receive wonderful local artifacts. The museum is located in the Old Carrabelle City Hall, built by local mason Marvin Justiss in 1938 during the Depression as a work program to employ locals. The museum has two floors of exhibit rooms and areas to show collections with a large foyer for special displays. We have several exhibits that highlight the Shipwrecks of Dog Island; Carrabelle’s Heroes & Notables; the story of Tate’s Hell Swamp; the Steamship Tarpon, which was key to building our community in the early 1900's; and Carrabelle's \"First People\", Indigenous people who lived here thousands of years ago. *** SPECIAL EXHIBIT Stories in Glass - A Vintage Bottle Exhibit The Carrabelle History Museum is pleased to announce a special display featuring vintage bottles of the Forgotten Coast. This exhibit will be on display from Wednesday, October 1 through Sunday, December 28. This unique exhibit will showcase a wide variety of interesting and historical bottles that tell the story of Franklin County’s heritage, industry, and everyday life. The display will feature Dr. Pierce’s Golden Medical Discovery bottle, found on nearby St. Vincent Island, once part of the estate of Dr. Raymond V. Pierce, a physician and patent medicine maker. His products, such as Dr. Pierce’s Favorite Prescription, Golden Medical Discovery, and Pleasant Pellets, made him a millionaire, with nearly a million bottles shipped each year. He also founded the Pierce Glass Company, which produced bottles for his own medicines and brands like Pond’s Extract and Lydia Pinkham. In 1907, he purchased St. Vincent Island in Franklin County, where he built a private preserve with roads, cottages, and imported game animals, until his death on the island in 1914. Other highlights of the exhibit include Coca-Cola bottles bottled locally in Apalachicola. The Apalachicola Coca-Cola Bottling Plant, in operation through the late 1970s, is remembered for its classic green glass bottles embossed with “Apalachicola, FLA” on the bottom. Today, these bottles are sought-after collectibles. Also on display are bottles from the shipwrecked SS Tarpon, including cherry bottles and beer bottles. Visitors will also see medicine bottles once used by local midwife Tillie Miller, local milk bottles, as well as perfume bottles, and other rare glass finds. All of which provide a glimpse into past daily life in Franklin County. Funded in part by the Franklin County Tourist Development Council. *** Loading Comments... Write a Comment...

Our museum, housed in a historic Pre-Revolutionary home and tavern in Weston, Massachusetts, tells the other side of the story – that of the Loyalists during the War of Independence. Notably, the Museum is among only a handful of institutions in the country dedicated to bringing to life the Loyalist experience. The Tavern was opened in 1770 by Isaac Jones, a Loyalist (or Tory) who advocated compromise over conflict with Great Britain at considerable personal risk. He ultimately joined the Patriot cause and went on to make significant contributions to the new republic. The Museum also tells the story of the six generations of the Jones family - Isaac’s direct descendants - who lived here for nearly 200 years up until the 1960s. The original house and tavern (built by Isaac 1765-1768) have been preserved in ways that allow each generation’s stories to come to light by exposing the structural layers of change specific to each time period. More than 70 percent of the items in the Museum’s collections are original to the Jones family. The Museum is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is entirely self-sustaining. Our Mission: The mission of the Golden Ball Tavern Museum is to promote, protect and preserve this rich educational resource as well as to advance the understanding of both the Loyalist experience during the American Revolutionary War and the 200-year history that was lived here by one family.

Photo courtesy of Val Atkinson . Fort Crook Museum & the Fort Crook Historical Society Photo courtesy of Val Atkinson . History of Fort Crook & the Fort Crook Historical Society Fort Crook was established on July 1, 1857, to protect travellers on the Shasta – Yreka Road and the Lockhart Ferries. Built by Company A, 1st Dragoons under the command of Captain John W. T. Gardner, the fort consisted of 25 – 30 log buildings enclosed by a pine-pole stockade 12 feet high. It was located on the Fall River about 7 miles north of the town of Fall River Mills, CA. Originally called Camp Hollenbush, the outpost was soon renamed in honor of Lt. George Crook , then in command of Company D, 4th Infantry. Crook became a General during the Civil War and gained national fame as both a fighter of and advocate for the Plains Indians. The fort was decommissioned in 1869. The Fort Crook Historical Society was founded in 1934. We are dedicated to collecting, preserving and presenting the history of the Intermountain area. The Fort Crook Museum was built in 1962 – 65 entirely by generous donations of time and materials by members of the communities it serves and by members of the Fort Crook Historical Society. Today it is a very active community enterprise. Many of our current members are family members of the first settlers, some simply appreciate the heritage generated by those settlers. The museum is host to a variety of community functions such as Pioneer Day, antique truck and tractor shows, weddings, reunions, school tours and other events. We have some large projects and a lot of small ones. New members are welcomed and appreciated for any kind of contribution, whether it be time spent in helping with planning, implementation, creative energy or, of course, financial.

The Museum actively acquires and holds in its care collections relating to the region’s heritage and provides a venue to showcase private collections and traveling exhibitions. The Museum serves as a center for research, education and lifelong learning by delivering quality programs that encourage knowledge, understanding, discussion and appreciation of our varied cultures. By honoring the record of life in the Santa Ynez Valley and Central Coast, we preserve these legacies for our children. COLLECTIONS The Museum houses a unique and broad collection of items celebrating the region’s forward movement into the West. The Parks-Janeway Carriage House displays the largest horse-drawn vehicle collection west of the Mississippi. In addition, visitors can see numerous examples of fine, regional saddlery, period apparel, and vintage horse gear illustrating the pride and craftsmanship of local and regional makers. EDUCATION By revisiting the past, we can truly appreciate the present and wonder what the future may bring. The Museum offers numerous lectures, garden & home tours, and events that celebrate the region’s agricultural strengths to present visitors with a true understanding of the diversity of the communities in the Santa Ynez Valley. In addition, programs and tours are offered to school-age visitors from around the valley and the county. EXHIBITS While the basis of the Museum’s presentation mission is displayed in the Carriage House, two additional exhibit rooms offer timely, multi-month exhibitions throughout the year curated by visiting experts and historians. From local artist displays to in-depth presentations of local ranching families to traveling exhibits of private collections; the Museum offers a wide variety of visual opportunities to experience the Valley and the area’s broad cultural offerings. “This is a beautiful little property right in the middle of the town. The stewards of this museum put a lot of love and effort into quality collections and exhibits.” Tara D.

We honor the African American artists from the past who endured and paved a way and the artists in the present who continue using their voice in a creative medium. The LMCC wants to highlight several African American artists of varying medias throughout the year because Black History is important all year.

Click on “Park Events” for details! Holiday Open House - December 7th 0 0 0 0 Days 0 0 Hours 0 0 Minutes 0 0 Seconds Welcome to Strathearn Historical Park Simí Valley History Preserved Strathearn Historical Park is 6½ acres in Simí Valley dedicated to the preservation of many of Simí’s earliest buildings. We are also the caretakers of hundreds of photographs, letters, personal items and other artifacts that record that lives of our early pioneers. The Park is open to the public, free of charge, Monday through Friday from 9:00am to 3:00pm, and Saturdays and Sundays from 1:00pm to 4:00pm. Trained Docents lead tours through the buildings on beginning at 1:00pm on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Meet the Strathearns Robert and Mary Strathearn and their seven children were Ranchers of about 14,000 acres beginning in the 1880’s. In 1968, the Strathearn Family donated the family home and the 6½ acres to the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District. The Park is managed in collaboration with The Simi Valley Historical Society. El Rancho Simí and the Home Ranch Rancho Simi was one of California’s largest land grants from the King of Spain. In 1795, Santiago Pico received these 113,000 acres of land. The property was purchased in 1842 by Jose de la Guerra, then in 1889 cattle ranchers Robert P. Strathearn and his wife Mary Lamb purchased 14,000 acres of the old Rancho. They transformed the original adobe into a kitchen and dining room. In 1892 they added a two-story Victorian style farmhouse to the adobe. The Strathearn family called this the Home Ranch lived in this house until 1968. The Colony Houses In 1888, a group of wealthy doctors from Chicago purchased 12 “kit houses” and had them shipped to Simí which was called Simíopolis at that time. Their plan was to start a health colony because they were told that the weather in California could heal any ailment. Strathearn Park has the last two remaining Colony Houses, the Haigh\/Talley and Printz\/Powell. The Haigh\/Talley home is included in the Docent-led tours. Fun Fact: These houses did not have indoor bathrooms or kitchens. They did not have electricity, water, gas or sewers. In fact, they didn’t ever have closets. Simi Library Prior to 1930, if you wanted a library book in Ventura County is could be in one of many, many locations such as church basements, schools and private homes. But the people of Simí wanted an actual library and this small building was the first purpose-built library in Ventura County. On display are photos of Simí’s first class of students, Ventura County’s first school bus, the original Simí High School and many library artifacts. This building is included in the Docent-led tours. Fun Fact: If you graduated from Simí High or Royal High School, then your picture is in the Strathearn Park Library! That’s right, because our library houses Annuals from both schools. Bañaga Barbershop Manuel Bañaga cut hair in this building as a barbershop from 1958 to 2008. Built around 1905, this barbershop was also a dry goods store, a family home, chiropractic office, and a café. Fun Fact: This shop has an early device for curling ladies hair that looks like something out of Dr. Frankenstein’s laboratory! Come see it. Saint Rose of Lima Church The Saint Rose of Lima Church was originally built as a Presbyterian church in 1902. But in 1902, there were very few people living in Simí and that had a hard time establishing a congregation. So in 1910 it became a Catholic mission church. It became the St. Rose of Lima church in 1922 and served as in important parish until 1964. Fun Fact: Before this parish moved to a much larger building, 5 Masses were held on every Sunday and still many had to listen from chairs outside of the building. Stop by and step back in history. Come into the Visitors Center and pick up a Park Guide with a map and useful information. And don’t hesitate to come by on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday for a Docent-led tour through the beautiful buildings. Hope to see you soon! Page load link Go to Top",

From then on, efforts were made to build and create the existing facilities and grounds.

Recently, the Bishop Paiute Tribe took the lead on the operations of the Cultural Center with the respect and reference from the local Owens Valley tribes. Today, we continue and honor the original purpose. For our community the Cultural Center serves as a living center, a place not only to preserve and tell the story of the old ways, but a community place to learn, teach and continue our traditional ways. Throughout the year we host various gatherings and events, both traditional and contemporary.

The centerpiece of STCHS is the Groveland Yosemite Gateway Museum in Groveland welcoming visitors from all over the world, and all year long. STCHS also advances its goals by building preservation projects, community education, and the History Resource Center. FAMILY, TURKEY, AND ..... GIFTS! It's getting to be that time of year. Chill in the air, color in the trees. Thoughts turning to family gatherings, turkey on the table, and presents under the tree. The Groveland Museum Gift Shop is your perfect one-stop shop for all your seasonal gift-giving needs. We have lots of new items this year. From puppets of all sizes for kids of all sizes to books on local history. We have a special range of items about Yosemite and the Sierra. And of course, we're 100% local - no annoying wait for the delivery man. Come by the Museum to look and get out your wallet! - A FUN TIME FOR ALL AT STCHS BARBECUE On Sunday, August 31, STCHS held its annual Labor Day Country barbecue at the PML Stables. On a warm sunny day over 100 Grovelanders and their families came out to enjoy tri-tip, hotdogs, and other goodies as well as a few fun events for the kids. As usual, the watermelon eating contest was the show stopper of the day! The event was a terrific success, and everyone should mark it on the calendar for next year too! - SUCCESSFUL OPEN HOUSE IN BIG OAK FLAT - On Saturday, June 21, STCHS held an Open House at the Wells Fargo Gamble building (built ~1852) and Cobden House (~1900) in Big Oak Flat. After 10 years since our last Open House, we wanted to showcase our efforts to preserve and improve them. New paint, vintage furniture, and electricity for the House. Electricity, a new roof, and general clean-up for WFG. A great crowd of over 150 locals and visitors came out to take a tour. Many commented that they \"always wanted to know more\" about the local landmarks on Hwy 120 in Big Oak Flat. The event was a terrific success, and we look forward to the sequels! ---- SPEAKERS PROGRAM SUCCESSES ----- The STCHS Speakers Program has seen a number of popular presentations since its revival in 2025. Suspended due to Covid, the program returned initially in 2024 and has solidified in 2025. Scheduled at 7 p.m. on the first Friday of every month, the presentations take place in the Groveland Resilience Center with audiences approaching 100 locals and visitors. Presentations have included the Donner Party, 100 years of Hetch Hetchy (pictured above), Yosemite wildlife. and the history of Pine Mountain Lake. The talks are free, and donations welcomed. ---- STCHS LEADS HISTORY SIGNS IN LAVERONI PARK ---- STCHS once again has made a mark in its community outreach. In 2024 the Groveland Community Service District (GCSD) asked STCHS to develop new history signage as part of a grant to improve Mary Laveroni Park. Partnering with GCSD, STCHS helped prepare a number of new signs depicting Groveland's history, including Mi-Wok and Hetch Hetchy, as well as a summary of Groveland's rich heritage (pictured). The new signs were just installed, so come by the Park and check them out (and notice the STCHS logo recognizing STCHS's key role.) VISIT THE MUSEUM - WE'RE OPEN!

The display includes stunning black-and-white photographs and interactive images of the faces of the lost children. An accompanying exhibit on the cultural impact of DeSoto County's early Jewish settlers, the Goodman family, is also on display. Treasures such as a 2,000-year-old oil lamp discovered in the Dead Sea Caves where the Dead Sea Scrolls were found on display and a vintage 1880s solid bronze Menorah or Hanukkah, which belonged to rural Mississippi Jewish settlers, are also on display. The heroic efforts of Col. William W. Goodman, who rescued 1,200 Jewish families, were chronicled along with a letter from famed Nobel Prize-winning scientist Albert Einstein, a relative of the Goodman family, whose assistance was sought to free mutual family members from the Holocaust. View More Featured Exhibits The Crumpler-Ferguson Log Cabin Walk Through Time The Crumpler-Ferguson Log Cabin has served, alternately, as a field hospital during the American Civil War, a way station for weary travelers along the Historic Hernando Plank Road to Memphis, a restaurant, and a family home. The past 150 years have not been kind to the cabin. Major renovation, including mud-chinking by specialists in that field, new vintage glass window panes, removal of rotting boards, and installation of air conditioning in one room, is planned so that classroom space can be provided for future generations who will come to the cabin to learn such vanishing crafts as butter churning and cheese making, lye soap making, quilting, chair caning, and weaving.

She continues to serve today as a museum ship and as a monument to the thousands of men and women who worked hard to build these ships in a time of national crisis. The SS Red Oak Victory is also one of the last surviving World War II Victory ships.

New Bridge served as a battleground, fort, encampment ground, military headquarters, and intelligence-gathering post in every year of the American Revolution. The Steuben House, a state historic site, is the only extant building remaining from the 1776 Retreat through Bergen County, the Retreat to Victory. The house was Washington's HQ while 14,000 soldiers camped nearby for 2 weeks in 1780. The State of New Jersey invited the Bergen County Historical Society to make its HQ here in 1939. ​ The Bergen County Historical Society is the largest landowner at Historic New Bridge Landing and the largest historical society in New Jersey.

Permanent exhibits include the infamous Big Horn Gun, a life size Pioneer cabin, exhibits on women, agriculture, music and the history of the jail. The museum also boasts a photo archive with more than 20,000 historic images that can be reproduced for a small fee.

The museum bookstore has hard-to-find materials dealing with the history of Gallatin County for sale at reasonable prices. The Gallatin Historical Society, founded in 1977, moved into two rooms in the county jail building in 1979. Built in 1911, the jail was already considered a historic structure. When prisoners were moved to the newly-constructed Gallatin County Detention Center in January 1982, the county commissioners granted the Society use of the entire building for a museum. The Pioneer Museum was created and in 2014 the name changed to Gallatin History Museum to better reflect the collection and the mission of the organization - to preserve, promote and foster the history of Gallatin County and Southwest Montana. The Gallatin History Museum is a 501(c)(3) non profit and is operated by the Gallatin Historical Society. It is not a county agency and does not receive any tax dollars, but instead relies strictly on memberships, donations, and memorials to operate. Members receive a magazine that features articles on local history, free admission to the museum and discounts in the bookstore.",

This is a walking tour through underground passageways, rooms, and courtyards. Guests will be walking on earthen terrain and should dress accordingly. Book Now Learn More Tags 1 Hour User All Ages See the beauty of Forestiere Underground Gardens! Take an hour-long guided walking tour through Baldassare Forestiere’s creation. See a hand-built network of underground rooms, courtyards, and passageways reminiscent of the ancient catacombs. Unique fruit-producing trees, shrubs, and vines growing underground — some over 90 years old! Ancient Roman architecture: arches, vaults, and stone-built walls. Underground micro-climates — temperature variations of 10 to 20 degrees! Underground home of Sicilian visionary and self-taught artist\/builder Baldassare Forestiere. In the early 1900s, Sicilian immigrant, citrus grower and visionary Baldassare Forestiere began turning what was useless farmland into a vast network of rooms, tunnels and courtyards as a subterranean escape from the sweltering Central Valley summer heat. Using only shovels, picks and other hand tools, Baldassare was inspired to excavate for forty years, going as deep as 25 feet underground and spanning over 10 acres. He grew fruit trees and grapevines underground — many of which are still thriving today! Today, guests from around the world tour through his grottos, passageways and underground homes at his underground gardens in Fresno. Although he never officially opened the Mediterranean resort of his dreams, we think Baldassare would be thrilled by all of the guests marveling at his life’s work today and finding inspiration underground.

    "homepage_content":"Colonial Fort Condé|History Museum of Mobile Colonial Fort Condé The History Museum of Mobile also operates Colonial Fort Condé located at 150 South Royal Street. The original Fort Condé was built in 1723 by French explorers. Under various colonial powers, it went by different names, including Fort Louis, Fort Charlotte, and Fuerta Carlota. The extant remnants of the original fort, discovered during the construction of the Wallace Tunnel in 1966, may be seen in Mardi Gras Park, facing Church Street. The replica fort was opened in 1976, as part of the nation’s bicentennial celebration. About one-third of the Fort was reconstructed, and at a four-fifths scale. Walk through the exhibits to see artifacts and recovered archaeological pieces of Mobile's colonial past. Or, tread atop the fort walls to see unmatched views of Mobile's skyline. Visitors can also enjoy a number of living history events held throughout the year. We will also have historical interpreters at Fort Condé Wednesday-Sunday, demonstrating aspects of daily life in colonial times, sharing about the lives and conditions that those early settlers lived under, and offering guided tours. We will also be providing classes in colonial arts, crafts, and trades, working with local craftsmen and organizations to develop historical learning classes structured to any skill level. Musketry demonstrations are held each Saturday at 11:00am and 2:00pm in the courtyard (weather- and staff-permitting). Admission to Fort Condé is included in your admission to the History Museum of Mobile. Hours of operation are Monday - Saturday 9 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. and Sunday 1 p.m. - 4:30 p.m. Contact: k.williams@historymuseumofmobile or call 251-544-5480.

    "homepage_content":"Elmore County Historical Society Our History In 1970, the Alabama Historical Commission, in an effort to encourage smaller communities throughout the state to collect, record, and preserve their local histories, instituted statewide organizational meetings of interested citizens. One such meeting was held in Wetumpka and led by the late Jeanette E. Barrett, former Wetumpka mayor and employee of the Alabama Historical Commission. The organizational meeting was attended by six or eight people who thought it was important to organize a local historical society, and the Elmore County Historical Society was formed. In May 1971, the charter for the organization was signed by about 100 Elmore County residents. Through the years, the Elmore County Historical Society, in conjunction with the Elmore County Museum, has sponsored various activities such as walking tours, arts programs, cemetery tours, and special exhibits at the museum to promote and preserve local heritage. The Museum The Elmore County Museum is a small, yet dynamic institution that aims to share the stories of Elmore County and its people. The museum features permanent as well as temporary exhibits, and provides educational programs year-round. The museum was housed in several locations before its permanent home in the historic Elmore County Post Office. Originally created by the Elmore County Historical Society, the museum has been administered by the City of Wetumpka since 2015. General Membership Membership is open to all persons or organizations interested in the history of Elmore County, Alabama. All persons or organizations desiring to help foster the stated objects and purposes of said Society may become members by requesting membership and paying membership dues. Membership is not restricted to residents of Elmore County but is open to anyone with a legitimate interest in the history and heritage of Elmore County and the preservation of its memory and historical landmarks. The amount required for annual dues is $20.00.

Following the American Revolution, Alexander McGillivray became a diplomat and negotiator for Creek towns. After initially working with the Spanish in Mobile and Pensacola, McGillivray turned to the burgeoning federal government of the United States to establish peace and trade. The resulting Treaty of 1790 was a significant and controversial document for both the United States and Creek, forever changing their diplomatic relationship with one another.

MORE INFO U.S. Army The U.S. Army is made up of the most dedicated, most respected soldiers in the world. These soldiers protect America's Freedoms while serving at home and abroad, and they are always prepared to defend the nation in times of need. Army Birthday - June 14, 1775 MORE INFO U.S. Navy America's Navy is a force as relevant today as it's been historically significant for the last 250 years. The times may change, the threats may become more obscure, the complex nature of the 21st century life may make the demand for such presence less obvious. However, now more than ever, the Navy is something to be aware of, something to be thankful for, and something to be proud of. Navy Birthday - October 13, 1775 MORE INFO U.S. Marines We are soldiers of the sea, providing forces and detachments to naval ships and shore operations. We are global leaders, developing expeditionary doctrine and innovations that set the example, and leading other countries' forces and agencies in the multinational military operations. These unique capabilities make us \"First to Fight,\" and our nations first line of defense.

The DRUM is the oldest American submarine on public display, and we invite you to come and learn about her 72 member crew and her missions during the war. Be sure to ask about Stateside, the crew’s pet dog who served aboard the submarine. USS DRUM was donated to the USS ALABAMA Battleship Commission on April 14, 1969 and was brought to Mobile to join the USS ALABAMA at Battleship Memorial Park as a war memorial and museum. She was opened to the public for tours on July 4, 1969. virtual Tour of the USS DRUM FUN FACTS USS DRUM EARNED 12 BATTLESTARS SANK 15 SHIPS SANK 80,580 TONS OF ENEMY SHIPPING USS ALABAMA and USS DRUM were both at the island of Majuro in the South Pacific in June 1944 being refitted for continued combat. It is the only known time that the BB-60 and SS-228 were in proximity during WWII. Wonder where USS DRUM got her name ? It was common for the US submarines to be named after fish. The DRUM refers to any of the various fish capable of making a drumming noise. The best known is the large sea bass off the North Atlantic Coast. Do you think DRUM’s insignia looks familiar? It was drawn by Walt Disney. The original artwork is on file in our Curatorial Department.

Learn More Visit CSKT.org Visitor Information The CSKT Bison Range is a historical wildlife conservation area home to roughly 350 bison. It was originally founded in 1908 as the National Bison Range on land belonging to the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes (CSKT). In recognition of their historical claim to both the land and the bison herd, the Bison Range was officially restored to the CSKT by Congress in 2020 as part of Public Law 116-260. As of 2022, the Bison Range is now fully owned and managed by the CSKT Natural Resource Department. Visitors to the Bison Range can enjoy a self-directed driving tour along two scenic drives. Our main tour road is Red Sleep Drive, which goes over Red Sleep Mountain. Combined with the lower Prairie Drive, it forms a 19 mile, 2 hour loop. Red Sleep Drive is only open during the summer (May-Oct) and has two walking trails. The drive includes scenic views of the valley as well as possibly spotting bears, birds, and other interesting species.

We are a certified as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, and membership dues are used for preservation and educational efforts throughout the Tennessee Valley region. We meet the second Thursday of every month starting at 6:30 PM, except for December. Our meetings are physically held at: Huntsville Elks Lodge 725 Franklin St. SE Huntsville, AL The program will always feature a nationally or regionally known speaker, and we are well known for covering a wide variety of Civil War topics. Annual membership dues are $30 per household, which includes up to two members per household. Free memberships are offered to full-time students (elementary through undergraduate). The Little Round Table (LRT) Discussion Group is our second monthly forum where a smaller group of interested members and guests enjoy an in-depth discussion of a Civil War topic. The LRT meets at the Elks Lodge at 6:30 PM, the fourth Thursday of every month except November (the last meeting of the year takes place the second Thursday of December, in place of a general meeting). For questions about the TVCWRT, call (256) 278-5533 . We also have a Facebook page. Our mailing address is: Tennessee Valley Civil War Round Table P.O. Box 2872 Huntsville, Alabama 35804 E-mail: tvcwroundtable@gmail.com President’s Welcome Welcome to the Tennessee Valley Civil War Roundtable (TVCWRT) website! We hope that you will enjoy the experience. Our experts have created many educational resources for your consideration. This non-partisan nonprofit 501 (c)(3) is one of the finest Civil War Round Tables in America. We are all about Education and Preservation of American Civil War History in a non-partisan environment. Our model offers more than most CWRTs such as an annual field trip to a local battlefield and a second, smaller roundtable for members in good standing. The Little Round Table small group meets monthly. It allows for a deep dive into a wide variety of topics. We have scholars and laypersons sharing ideas and leading discussions. The majority of our board members are veterans. Their total military service exceeds 175 years! Since 1993, our organization has studied many battles which are now sacred spaces around our precious country. We learn about curiosities of the American Civil War. We enjoy fellowship with others who share an interest in this unique period of our American history. We are glad you are with us in 2025, this special year commemorating 160 years since the end of the war and the beginning of reconciliation. During the course of our 32 years, we have raised over $24,000 from our Battlefield Bucket effort.

Explore Activities Trade Days Events View Maps New Bike Trails Nature has blessed Tannehill The beautiful tree-lined valley, hillsides rich in ore and swiftly flowing Roupes Creek made this a perfect setting for a successful iron making operation, as the early settlers realized. The same ingredients afford today’s visitors a pleasurable escape from modern life. Tannehill Ironworks Historical State Park has more than 1,500 acres in three counties set aside for hiking, camping and outdoor recreation. A miniature railroad chugs through the pines. From spring through fall, the blacksmith, miller and craftsmen demonstrate their trades. Craft shops occupy restored pioneer cabins and artisans chat with visitors from their front porches. Steeped in history, Tannehill feels timeless. The cotton gin, pioneer farm and working gristmill preserve a long-gone way of life. Hiking trails retrace historic roadways. Artifacts of Alabama’s 19th century iron industry displayed in the Iron and Steel Museum put in perspective the massive stone furnaces, Tannehill’s awe-inspiring centerpiece.

This museum tells the story of Baltimore’s industrial heritage. Thomas H Mechanicsburg, PA I have visited this museum for years with my two children, and there is always something new to see or to build. I think my son’s decision to pursue Industrial Design as a career was partly inspired by this Museum. We love it. Steven M Baltimore, MD 4.6 \/ 5.0 Visitor Reviews This was very interesting. Almost all the exhibits were about things unique to Maryland and especially Baltimore. It is interesting to learn about the industrial uses of things like electricity and gas and how the introduction of these helped industries, and therefore, the city grow. Linda D Visitor I went to the Museum of Industry for a work meeting and the Museum exceeded my expectations. The history and displays here are fascinating!

Frank Current Exhibits on Display The Heritage and Research Center is primarily a collections storage facility and research center rather than a museum, but we do curate small exhibits for public viewing: Yellowstone National Park: Travel through Time. This exhibit explores travel through Yellowstone National Park from the earliest Native American groups and European American trappers and surveyors to present-day visitors. It examines how the area has been managed over time, how visitors tour the park on land, water, and snow, and how the National Park Service uses technology to steward the land and protect its visitors.

The library collection consists of more than 20,000 books, periodicals, theses and dissertations, maps, unpublished manuscripts, microforms of historic newspapers and scrapbooks, brochures, technical reports, and audio-visual material. Support from Yellowstone Forever , private donors, and federal funding have allowed our staff to curate an impressive, possibly unsurpassed, library of Yellowstone’s resources. The library collection is owned by the National Park Service and is managed through a cooperative agreement process with the Great Basin Institute. U.S. Army Yellowstone Archives Archival Collections The Yellowstone Archives and collections are open by appointment only . The Yellowstone Archives contains records documenting the natural and cultural resources of Yellowstone. They also detail the military administration of the park (1886-1918), the evolution of the national park concept following Yellowstone's establishment, the formulation of management policies, records of park concessioners, and ongoing developments in park management today. The collection includes historic maps, photographs, films, oral histories, administrative records, and scientific data. The Yellowstone Archives is an affiliate of the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), which allows the park to permanently hold federal records instead of transferring them to the National Archives. While legal custody of these records belongs to NARA, physical custody is kept by Yellowstone National Park to allow researchers to have the best access to both current and historical resources in one location.

(307) 344-2564. The herbarium primarily contains plants collected in Yellowstone. Our specimens document the presence of plants in the park over time, and the history of plant collecting in the park. The collection includes more than 17,000 specimens of vascular and non-vascular plants, fungi, and lichens. Our oldest specimens date to 1899 and traveled to the World Fair in 1903. The specimens are available for scientific study via loans to accredited institutions. Generally, loans are made for taxonomic or floristic research only, but exceptions may be made for other botanical investigations. A loan request from the researcher or curator of the institution where the specimens are to be shipped must be submitted in writing, email preferred . Herbarium Visitation Guidelines First-time visitors must receive an orientation and specimen handling instructions. Great care should always be used when handling specimens. Specimens should be held flat with both hands, such that the paper cannot bend and damage the specimen. Similarly, folders should always be carried horizontally and fully supported. Specimens in folders should never be shuffled as it can lead to damage of the underlying specimen. Furthermore, specimens should never be turned over as a page in a book. To inspect the contents of a folder, place it flat on a table, and stack specimens face up neatly to one side. Specimens on acidic paper should be maintained in a separate folder from the specimens on acid-free paper. Never rest objects such as books, elbows, etc., on specimens or folders. Specimens in need of annotation or repair should be brought to the attention of the herbarium staff.

Photo by James Hefelfinger (Hefelfinger Collection, MSA SC 1885-783-2, Maryland State Archives). The World War II Memorial Commission was authorized by statute in 1991 (Chapter 380, Acts of 1991) and reconstituted by the Governor in 1994 (Executive Order 01.01.1994.20). The Commission advised the Governor and General Assembly on the design, construction, and placement of a memorial or monument to those Marylanders who served in World War II (Code 1957, Art. 41, sec. 18-303). In August 1997, the Board of Public Works approved the construction contract for the Memorial. The groundbreaking ceremony for the $2.3 million monument was held on October 29, 1997. The Memorial was built on Route 450 overlooking the Severn River in Annapolis. Designed by New York architect Secundino Fernandez, the Memorial consists of a rectangular amphitheater surrounded by columns and granite slabs inscribed with the names of 6,454 Marylanders who died in World War II. Stone panels and mosaic circles further depict Maryland's role in the War. In September 1992, the Commission submitted a report to the Governor and General Assembly. Authorization for the Commission was extended to when the Memorial was dedicated on July 23, 1998 (Executive Order 01.01.1994.29), and formally rescinded in December 2008 (Executive Order 01.01.2008.19).

Thanks to a generous donation from the Southern Maryland Audubon Society, we are excited to be able to offer you a live-stream feed of an Osprey nest here at the park. Osprey are generally most active on this nest site between mid March and early July, however, it is not uncommon to have other birds such as Bald Eagles stop to rest on the platform at other times of the year. Please note that this is a wild Osprey nest, and even though park staff is as hopeful as you are for a successful nesting season each year, we do not interfere with their natural cycle which sometimes may include interactions with predators or natural disasters. Park Staff work with a licensed bird bander each year to monitor the chicks and put a federal identification band on their leg. These band numbers are recorded in a federal database and allow scientists to share data about where Osprey travel. For many years we had a female on this nest tagged as Z07, whose leg band allowed us to track her all the way to where she was born in Northern Ohio. We hope our continued monitoring efforts will allow similar tracking of other Osprey in the future.​​​​​​ Our Social Media Channels We're available on the following channels.

Source: HearHere Military Vehicles The HMMV is home to around 100 authentic vehicles including helicopters, tanks, halftracks, ambulances, and jeeps from every branch of service- many of which are fully-restored and operational. Vehicles date from World War II and include rarities such as a Downed Airman Retriever, one of only a handful remaining in the world. This hands-on museum invites you to see, touch, and even sit in our unique inventory of vehicles. Ongoing restoration projects continue with help from many sources. Military Memorabilia HMMV also features numerous displays of items and artifacts that were everyday necessities for soldiers. Included are a large exhibit of military weapons, uniforms, engines, equipment, and much more. Displays primarily include items from World War I onward, although a few Civil War weapons and artifacts are also included. These displays seek to help guests gain a better understanding of the daily lives of U.S. soldiers. One exhibit teaches visitors about Meals Ready to Eat (MREs), and guests can even purchase authentic MREs from the gift shop. Make a donation. The Museum’s founders have always felt that this should be a memorial “from the people, to the people.” If their dream of a national museum is to be realized, help from many sources is essential and greatly appreciated. Take a moment to reflect on the proud past of these authentic restorations and the men and women who served with them. Donate Gift Shop The Museum also includes a gift shop featuring a variety of products, including t-shirts, hats, remote-controlled toy military vehicles, flags, books, MREs, patches and more!

But the lots are not explained because you have lots on the river side we would like to have had.But got stuck across the street.lots are tight and to close together.No privacy!In all we had a wonderful Christmas! – Ann S. | Facebook Nice quiet campground.

This 1834 Italianized home was built by Mr. William Sayre as his primary residence. Sayre, served as an early City Councilman, two term Mayor, and helped build the railroad linking Montgomery with Mobile. Prior to 1861, consecutive owners were instrumental in building the gas company, icehouse, Montgomery's banking system, and an owner of one of Montgomery's Iron Works factories. These owners were instrumental in modernizing Montgomery into a bustling Antebellum City by 1861. In the spring of 1861, the newly formed Confederate government rented this home as an executive residence for President Jefferson Da vis and his young family. The FWH is decorated seasonally to reflect the holidays of historical periods.

Prairie Flower Leather Co. specializes in the manufacture of anachronistic, archaic and obscure items targeting a clientage of limited and specific scope and nature. TRANSLATION: We build weird stuff that nobody really needs, but if you want one and can't find an original, you've come to the right place. Here's an overview of what we do here. Our WWI reproductions consist mainly of hard to locate items and parts that anyone who is involved with collecting or re-enacting needs to complete an outfit or finish a collection. We offer a fairly complete selection of helmet liners, representing five countries and a cross section of years ranging from 1914 through 1920. We also offer the impossible to find, don’t see what you need, ask us, we’ll try to make that happen for you! All of our products in this category are manufactured on the machines that were originally used to make them. For example, if you have a Pickelhaube and need a liner for it, rest assured your liner will be sewn on a 1913 German Dorkopp treadle sewing machine. Everything we build, we build here, in our own shop, in the UNITED STATES of AMERICA. NOTHING is shipped overseas or comes from anywhere but here! If you don't find it in our inventory, give us an opportunity to build it for you, you won't be disappointed. Message from Owner Be Awed, Amazed, and Astounded!

As one of America’s leading veterans service organizations with more than 250,000 members, AMVETS has a proud history of assisting veterans and sponsoring numerous programs that serve our country and its citizens. The AMVETS Department of Nebraska was officially established in 1994. Foresighted veterans of other Organizations recognized the shrinking numbers of combat and combat-era veterans who were meeting eligibility requirements to join VSOs [Veterans Service Organizations]. What they determined was that a whole lot of young folks were out there who had served, but who were not necessarily eligible for their own Organizations [i.e.: V.F.W. (Veterans of Foreign Wars), The American Legion, D.A.V. (Disabled American Veterans), etc.]. With the more recent global situations, obviously times have changed! Conflicts have continued to arise and the number of veterans in need of guidance and assistance has grown. AMVETS members participate in post activities for fun, community service, and to help fellow veterans across many aspects of life.

Heritage Tree In 2017, Nebraska celebrated the Sesquicentennial of our state. To highlight this anniversary, the Brownville Historical Society chose the HERITAGE TREE as a part of the State’s celebration. This tree represents several symbols of Brownville’s rich history, from a riverboat to the Railroad, the Theater to the Concert Hall, the Civil War cannon to the Winery. Located in downtown Brownville, the Tree is modeled after similar civil monuments in Southern Germany called Stammbaums. This wood and steel structure stands 29 feet tall above ground. The significant heritage of Brownville began in 1854. Early settlers led by former Governor Robert Furnas, planted thousands of trees in the Loess soil. The apple tree at the top of the HERITAGE TREE represents this early Nebraska effort. The HERITAGE TREE came into being as businesses joined together to design, construct and finance this project. Brownville is a Preserve America Community; many properties reside in the National Historic District in Brownville. Governor Furnas Arboretum & Gazebo The Gov. Furnas Arboretum is a picturesque tribute to Nebraska's 2nd Governor, Robert W. Furnas. The newest addition to the site is a gazebo highlighting the life and history of Furnas.

Book A Tour About The Copper King Mansion William A. Clark was among the most powerful, richest and influential people in the late 1800s and early 1900s. He made a fortune with smelters, electric power companies, newspapers, railroads and mining. He settled in Butte, Montana and is known as one of the three \"Copper Kings\". Las Vegas was originally known as “Clarks Las Vegas” because he was responsible for subdividing Freemont Street, located in Clark County Nevada. He also built one of the most elaborate homes on 5th Avenue in New York City, just across from Central Park. W. A. Clark began construction on this mansion in 1884 and it was completed in 1888. Construction was under the direction of architect - D. T. McDevitt, and the woodwork accomplished by the W. F. Beall & Co. out of Chicago. Most of the materials for the home were imported at a cost of around $260,000. The majority of the home is in the original condition from 1888. You will see frescoed ceilings, stained glass windows, hand combed plaster walls, and gas & electric chandeliers. The home is privately owned by Erin Sigl who’s Grandmother purchased the house in 1953, and Erin and her husband Pat still live here. The tour takes approximately one hour and is truly exceptional.
