    "homepage_content":"Palomino Espresso Thursday, 19 July 2012 The 2 Month Review Wow, my baby Palmoino Espresso is 2 months old. Time flys!! Firstly a huge thank you to all our lovely customers. Opening on York Street in the city I never expected to feel such a sense of community with the workers near by. Its been great getting to know you all, learning the coffee orders (slowly) and generally beginning to feel like we're part of the area. Thank you for supporting us, it makes getting up at 3am to bake all worth while! Other exciting developments since we opened are the start of our coffee tastings on Tuesday afternoons. They've been running these past couple of weeks with customers sampling the cold drip, pour overs and we've even got the antique lever machine running which has been a huge hit. Don't forget to pop in next Tuesday 2-3pm to try something new from our caffeine menu. You also may have noticed our new menu boards, wohoo!! I've uploaded a couple of photos of us making and installing below. It was quite an amusing \/ stressful day..... learning on the job for sure, another DIY success me thinks. Anyho now that life is a little more routine, I will attempt to be more regular with the blog posts.... attempt :) Tony looking serious using the lever on Ol Queenie Charlie looking scary cutting up the menu boards Me looking stupid trying to hold the boards straight and the nearly finished menus :) Posted by Palomino Espresso at 01:02 2 comments: Email This BlogThis! Share to X Share to Facebook Share to Pinterest Monday, 11 June 2012 Lazy long weekend Charlie studying the menu at Toast Hope everyone has had a fab long weekend. The weather couldn’t have been soggier but I’ve got to admit I enjoyed the cosiness of it all. I have appreciated some serious chill time after last weeks 14 hour working days. I also got to enjoy relaxing at other peoples cafes which I always find invigorating! This weekend we went to old favourites Toby' s in Wooloomooloo, biggest servings of scrambled eggs in Sydney! Toast in Surry Hills, love the ever changing brekkie specials and La Banette Pattisserie in Glebe, nobody does pastries quite like this place. This morning myself and Wifey were back at the kitchen stove prepping up lots of food ready for tomorrow. We’ve got slow cooked beef and gravy ready for the pies. Made more of our famous granola. Even stewed up some chickens for delicious chicken and mushroom pies. Tomorrow morning we’ll get into the shop and actually make the pies up so they’ll be fresh out the oven ready for lunch. Nothing beats a warm house-made pie on a winters day. Get in quick before they run out! What the final product will look like! Posted by Palomino Espresso at 00:45 No comments: Email This BlogThis! Share to X Share to Facebook Share to Pinterest Monday, 4 June 2012 I wish that I knew then what I know now Much has been learnt in the past 2 weeks of opening. The learning curve sure is steep but I am loving the challenge. It’s exciting, its nail biting and I have a funny feeling in my toe. What follows therefore is my list of 10 ‘I wish I knew then what I know now’ moments. Feel free to take the advice and not make these school boy errors in your own business….. oh and you can have a listen to Rod Stewart whilst doing so. Faces - Ooh La La (this link will take you away from page, I'm not clever enough to know how to do otherwise) 1. Order products with plenty of time to actually arrive Avoid the nervous wait to see if you'll actually have chairs for customers to sit on. 2. Never trust the council when they say “it only takes 4-5 weeks” City of Sydney Council moves about as fast as an arctic glacier. We put in our development application for a sign and outdoor seating the day after we signed the lease. This now means our application has been in process for 8 weeks without an answer! I feel certain that if we had hounded them more things may have gone a little quicker. We left it 3 weeks before the first call to see how it was all progressing and they hadn't even started! Only after that first call did things get rolling, oooh so slowly. 3. In your first few days – go simple Prepared or not service will be slightly crazy in those first few days\/weeks. The processes are still being worked out and fine tuned. Its best, therefore to just do the basics well. We spent days thinking of an awesome menu only to scrap half at the end of the week because certain things just didn't work. You need to think about what the capacity of your kitchen can handle - lots of different dishes means more ingredients to order, increased stock to store and generally slower service time. We've culled our menu down to the best dishes. These dishes can be concentrated on, perfected and the whole operation is altogether smoother and simpler. 4. Don’t have your opening party the night before you actually open Bad move on our behalf. Not quite sure what we were thinking when this decision got made. Worries about your first day only get multiplied by worries of also having a successful opening night party. Try chatting to friends and family whilst also working out in your head all that needs to get done before the next morning. Factor in clean up, next days food prep, baking and a little bit more baking and you end up going to bed at 2.30am in the morning and waking up 1.5 hours later at 4.30am to start your very first day of trade. Not to be re-lived. 5. Prepare blog entries in advance of busy times Yes, as I'm sure you were only too aware of my lack of blog entries over the past 2 weeks. Working 14 hour days does not bode well for successful posts. Would have been good to have a few pre-written posts up my sleeve. 6. Start looking for good quality staff, early! Mad rushes to hire anyone who walks in off the street don't usually lead to quality staff. We've found a few gems this way but we've also found plenty of duds too. 7. Get a sign This could depend of your location and frontage but we definitely need a sign. A sign was something seen as not essential in the build up to opening and in hindsight this was right, it wasn't. But now things are up and running and people are trying to find us or even just see the shop from across the road, the lack of signage is becoming a distinct disadvantage. 8. Get your website up prior to opening Oh to have free time again. I remember, not so long ago before Palomino opened lounging about the house thinking that I really should write the content for my website. Old lazy Liesel decided that it would be much easier once the cafe opened. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Bad lazy Liesel, you will have no time once your shop opens and the website will become the monkey on your back gnawing at your thoughts and generally making things feel unfinished. 9. Spend time on your budget – 20mins of guess work is not enough is it Liesel? No it is not. I got off pretty lucky on this one as we did finish the cafe under budget. However, I did see how it could so easily go very wrong. We did a rough budget and thought it was fantastic. Fast forward 2 months and we realise we'd forgotten to factor in costs like carpenter fees, general building costs, astronomical legal fees and shelving. We saved our butts by not spending as much in other areas. 10. Accept that not everything will be perfect when you open No one will notice all those minor details stressing you out. Go with the flow, smile and you can sort out the little stuff on your next day off! the cute puppy has nothing do to with the post, i just wanted to draw you in. mwah ha ha ha Posted by Palomino Espresso at 01:04 No comments: Email This BlogThis! Share to X Share to Facebook Share to Pinterest Sunday, 3 June 2012 Thank you all! Oh my goodness, I've sat down to write this blog entry at least 5 times. It's just really hard to know where to begin when so much has happened! I’ll start with the opening night, attended by so many of our friends and family. What a wonderful\/nerve racking experience it was to show off the place and the hard work to you all. Thanks for coming along and thank you especially for all the support provided in the run up to opening. The generosity of your time and help is something I will never forget. To those of you that turned up after work to help paint or tile. Even when most of the help was through motivational chatter. To my Mum and Charlie who stayed the night before opening till 2.30am only to get up at 4am for more baking… yep folks 1.5 hours sleep for my first day! Karl my brother, you were always there when needed, so much would have been impossible without your strength (as in muscles). Heidi my sister, you have given up so much of your time, I would never have even opened that first day if it weren’t for you. That goes for you too Aaron (Morgan’s Coffee), your help has gone above and beyond the call of duty and your coffee knowledge is inspiring. Lastly, a huge thank you to the wonderful customers who have ventured into Palomino Espresso over the last 2 weeks. No we don’t have a sign yet and yes we are smiling at you but you risked it anyway! Thanks, you have all been lovely and we really appreciate your support. Gushy gushness. Alright well I’ve got it all out there now. And in the process I have also got back on the blogging bandwagon. Yeehar! Stay tuned, the routine is back….. tomorrow i’d like to talk about all the lessons learnt from opening week, a good one for any café owners to be! Ahhh, feels good to be back. bottled cold drip! lotsa goodies old American milk caps Posted by Palomino Espresso at 02:30 No comments: Email This BlogThis! Share to X Share to Facebook Share to Pinterest Sunday, 13 May 2012 Favourite Sydney Coffee and Foodie Blogs Extra reading makes you look smart and sound clever. This is why I’d like to recommend some of the latest and bestest foodie\/coffee blogs out there at the moment. All of the below are fun to read, pretty to look at and very informative. Not one of these writers will use the word ‘bestest’ but all of them are guaranteed to make you more knowledgeable and therefore desirable.... just sayin’. The Bean Stalker : Brisbane based coffee worshipping blog written by a professional roaster. Love the in-depth, passionate discussions about coffee brewing methods and all the interesting vidoes too. This guy knows what he's talking about. An inspiring and hugely informative read. Fork It : Fork It food blog is a mix of detailed flowing reviews and mouth watering recipes all created by aspiring chef and writer Oni. Her posts are passionate and have a hint of Nigella Lawson about them “i get intimate with the produce”. Totally into the feel of this blog and always left inspired to cook. Big plus for vegetarians as reviews will usually comment on what veggie options were available at the time. Corridor Kitchen : Really like this blog which reviews cafes, products, recipes, events in the inner Sydney area. The posts are honest and hearty with the writer always mentioning the coffee. I like how any criticism is constructive and always fair. I get the feeling she genuinely would like all the places on her radar to be good but is willing to give reasons as to why something may not have been working that day. The aesthetics and layout of this blog make it a pleasure to peruse around and I often find myself enticed into other articles from interesting photos and post titles. Sydney Coffee Nerd : Sold purely by the scoring system on this blog. Max 10 point score in 4 categories of coffee style, coffee experience, cafe cool, cafe service. Looooove it, detailed and mildly neurotic, what a joy. The writer is super honest and quietly amusing. I find this blog is best appreciated smirking whilst stroking a white fluffy cat with ones hook. Definitely one of my favourites. The Adventures Of Miss Piggy : I enjoy the way Miss Piggy writes, each blog post feels like a mate is talking to you. Complete with humour and Dad joke puns to match. Posts are always accompanied by large good quality photos, which is awesome for folks like me that get put off by too many words. My favourite thing however, about Miss Piggy’s blog are the pages ‘Sydney Eating Wishlist’ and ‘Global Eating Domination’. I generally like people who aspire to be dictators and Miss Piggy is no exception. She ticks off the list once each said establishment has been visited - rule that list! Secret Foodies : This is a must read for food enthusiasts in the Sydney area. Plenty of beautifully crafted, flowing reviews to be had on this site. You can sit in the comfort of your own home and read about the fun other people have had at various lovely restaurants. Orrr are we feeling a bit crazy tonight? Well if so, sign yourself up for a food adventure into the unknown! Secret Foodies run surprise themed dinners. You buy a ticket and then couple of hours before the event you find out where you're off to! Go and meet up with other like minded culinary explorers! The Unbearable Lightness of Being Hungry : Cute little unassuming blog thats been going for an age in terms of blogg ing time (since 2007). I like how the writer is clearing just doing this for love of food. Simple but beautiful pictures and posts keep me coming back, keep it up! The Coffee Guide : Fun and interactive Australian cafe review website. Download the app and rate cafes that you visit, even score your barista! Each week a new cafe\/barista will be awarded top dog and get an interview on the front page of the website for the whole next week. A Table For Two : Ex-masterchef contestant Billy Law has set up a pretty dandy website featuring the best eats in Sydney and around the world. The reviews are largely for Asian style restaurants and dishes with food photography that will leave you salivating. This list is by no means an exhaustive one. Australia is especially passionate about food and coffee so there are lots of awesome foodie blogs out there. If you know of an especially good one that I've left off this list let me know in the comments and i'll be sure to check it out. Posted by Palomino Espresso at 00:08 3 comments: Email This BlogThis! Share to X Share to Facebook Share to Pinterest Wednesday, 9 May 2012 Making personal sacrifices to set up a business I tumbled out of bed this morning to find my feet caught up in the piles of clothes currently layering my floor. Right now, you wouldn’t even know that my bedroom does in fact have beautiful wooden floorboards. I fumble around the drawers to find there’s not an awful lot about in terms of clothes. Clean knickers anybody? Oh the personal sacrifices made in the run-up to opening this cafe. Many people don’t realise the full extent of how much time you have to give to setting up a new business. Or, if you’re like me you had an idea but when it comes down to it, that doesn’t make the workload any easier! I honestly cannot remember the last time I cooked and ate at home, maybe it was the previous Thursday when I had a pot noodle. Recently every meal has either been scoffed amongst the rubble of the shop or eased down with a scooner at the pub. Vegetables - a treat of the past, a dream of the future. I can only sigh and watch my waist-line expand. What’s that place the gym? Uh, I feel tired just thinking about it. Think i’ll have to have a lie down. Other luxuries that quickly slip down the list of priorities: Personal Hygiene : No one notices how greasy your hair is when you're covered in dust and paint 24\/7. Brush teeth or go straight to bed, what a conundrum! ohhh bed your looking rather lovely this evening. Friends: I’m not sure mine exist anymore. One day i’ll get to see them again.... at the end of that rainbow. Relationships: Persuade other half that trip to Ikea is actually romantic date. Stop half way round at Ikea cafe and buy her $4.95 dinner, kerrr-ching! Wearing nice clothes: I’m pretty sure board shorts and flannel-shirts are in right now. Weekends: I was never a fan anyway. Oh and in case you were wondering I bought myself new underwear today. Forget laundry, I just don’t have the time! Posted by Palomino Espresso at 03:27 No comments: Email This BlogThis! Share to X Share to Facebook Share to Pinterest Monday, 7 May 2012 Supplier shout out - part 1 We’re getting to the stage where the place is actually starting to look like a cafe you might want to go to. So I'm thinking now is probably a good time to mention some of the excellent suppliers we have used along the way and why they could be good for your business too. Just to note these are all suppliers to help actually build\/set your hospitality business up. We will go through food and produce suppliers in a later blog. IronWood - IronWood are timber specialists and have a large selection of beautiful recycled wood. Myself and my partner felt pretty stupid the first time we walked in here. We were like “we want some wood” (yes, yes, let the jokes fly). Anyway the boys and girls at IronWood are always ready to lend a hand. They have a certain way of doing business which basically involves speed walking around the timber yard, pulling out various hunks of wood whilst you decide what you like. All the wood in our shop is from this place; the counter, the tables, the back wall panelling. If you need any of the wood stained or shaped they can do this too and then deliver right to your door step. Mitchell Road Auction Centre - Theres lots of cool second hand furniture and knick knack stores out there but we've found a couple that come up trumps time and time again. The Mitchell Road Auction Centre in Alexandria is a two storey treasure chest of antique and design furniture, kitchen ware and bitsa. We also think that this place also seems slightly cheaper than everywhere else, so if you hunt there are bargains to be had. Our other favourite second hand store is Doug Up On Bourke . This shop is so fun to walk around, they have everything - even a giant camel! Looking for lights, cool signs, random eceletica you'll find it all here. Cafe Ideas - They've been in the industry for donkeys years and are the place to go for your large kitchen equipment e.g. display fridge, oven, sandwich press. Shop around for a good price and these guys will usually match it. You can either buy these products out-right or through silver chef which is like leasing the equipment till you pay it off. Silverchef leasing is a really good idea for startup businesses. It means you get brand new equipment without the initial hefty cost. Ebay - Great for picking up little gems and second hand equipment. Be uber careful about buying previously owned kitchen goods. You might feel like you're getting a bargain but when your fridge breaks down in the middle of service, you'll wish you spent those extra bucks. You can also pick up some decent catering equipment at Omaras auction house in Rozelle. Bunnings - I practically feel like I own shares in Bunnings having spent so much money and time in this place of late. However, I have to say that owning shares wouldn’t be a bad idea as this place sells everything and their staff are super helpful. I am totally clueless about anything D.I.Y related but Bunnings seem to have an expert in each section that’ll run through the whole process and show you what you need. We found the store in Alexandria to be particularly accommodating. Lastly my big thanks to the tradies: Fred, not Bob the Builder Fred the Builder Barry the Electrician Michael the Plumber If you are looking for a trades person that comes with a recommendation then email me hello@palominoespresso.com.au and I would happily suggest and pass on any of the above guys contact details. As I said previously, this is just the start of the list and I look forward to revealing all the foody suppliers soon. Posted by Palomino Espresso at 04:43 1 comment: Email This BlogThis!

Submit Address 7 Commerce Cres, Hindmarsh Valley SA 5211, Australia Phone +61420308005 Email corey@kingrestos.com.au ABN 43925984183 About King Restorations Ever since grandpa let me tinker in his shed in the school holidays I knew I was going to do this forever. He let me be creative and never a negative word said. Fast forward to high school and when I walked through the woodwork classroom I felt at home. Not being book smart, but excelling at tech subjects, the school was encouraging to help me transition to TAFE. I knew it had to be wood related. So, I enrolled in a full time cabinet making course at 15. It soon became apparent that the detail work and finishing was my passion. Seeing the grain “pop” when that first coat of finish was applied, how satisfying. At 16, I started an apprenticeship at a finishing company and did my studies at Marlston TAFE. We were able to restore a train carriage and some pieces we bought from home. This was it, restoration was for me! I’ve had many jobs in the industry, but the skills gained by working with Chris Sorensen at The Adelaide Furniture Doctor over the years has been amazing. Our shared passion, and experiences on and off for the past 20+ years has got me where I am today. I’ve also been able to work alongside Richard from Wicker Works, where he taught me how to replace sheet cane. I’m so fortunate to have had these skills passed to me. I still contract for Chris when I’m needed. Having a laugh and still learning. Thank you for taking the time to read my story. Please have a look at the gallery of work I have completed, and let me know if I can restore or create something for you. Cheers Corey King. Reviews Our dining table finish was in a poor state, when it arrived back after Corey's TLC it was actually nicer than the original finish when new. Corey is a true craftsman and reliable too. I can't recommend him highly enough to someone that requires any furniture restoration or manufacture. Thanks Corey 😊 Mick Lyne 5 Stars Very happy with the rejuvenation of our Dining TableCorey was very good. Corey came to our home picked up the table to take it to his workshop. The table was then delivered back to meJust like new!Job well done! Judy Routley 5 Stars This old piece made by grandmother was found in an old barn after 45 years and restored beautifully by Corey and Zoe. So impressed and outstanding patience and workmanship. Anne Nancarrow 5 Stars I had two chairs in need of repair, one was a grandfather chair with a broken front leg, which I despaired would ever be fixed. The other chair, a beautiful ladies chair or occassional chair possibly from the 30's or even a little earlier, was in need of carpentry TLC. Corey King managed to fix both the chairs brilliantly. I would not hesitate to recommend him to others who are looking for furniture repairs. Positive Responsiveness, Quality, Professionalism, Value Linley Belford 5 Stars",

We’re part of the South Perth and Rockingham communities with a mission to make it easier for locals to shop fresh, eat well and support WA suppliers along the way. Our store is filled with everything you need for the week, from early morning coffee to ready meals, seasonal produce and seafood fresh from WA waters. You’ll find everyday staples, gourmet groceries and hard-to-find products from both local and international suppliers. Whether you’re planning dinner tonight, filling the pantry or exploring new ideas for your kitchen, we’re here to help. With friendly staff, honest pricing and a strong connection to local growers and producers, we offer more than convenience. We bring a sense of place to your weekly shop. Our Story We’ve been here for 25 years! Our store had a significant and major upgrade in 2021 & now a full rebrand. The shop was extended, a cafe added, and large, wide ailses were installed that make your shopping easy. Our Story Exceptional quality and range. We offer a curated mix of trusted WA favourites, organic produce, pantry essentials and ready-to-cook solutions that make shopping simpler. From fruit and veg to meat and dairy, our team selects each item with care. If it’s not good enough for our own kitchen, it won’t make it to the shelf. That’s the Malibu Market difference. Our range balances everyday needs with the excitement of discovery. You’ll find classic ingredients alongside emerging local products, seasonal specials and gourmet lines that change through the year. Whether you’re buying a family’s worth of food or just picking up a few essentials, our focus is on quality, freshness and variety without the fuss of bigger chains. Our Range Fresh Produce Our produce is sourced daily from WA growers and markets. Everything is hand-selected by our experienced buyer to ensure only the freshest fruit and vegetables make it to the shelf. Whether you’re grabbing salad for dinner or stocking the fridge for the week, you’ll find the best of the season here. We take pride in offering more than just freshness. Our produce section is built around relationships with farmers and suppliers who care about what they grow. This means fewer chemicals, better taste and a real difference in your meals. You’ll also see signs that tell you where items come from, what’s in season and how best to use them at home. Butcher You’ll find a wide range of premium meat from WA producers, including beef, lamb and chicken. It’s all fresh, never frozen, and portioned in store by our butcher team. Ask us about serving sizes or cuts for a recipe. We’re happy to help with practical advice and the best picks of the week. We believe fresh meat should be part of everyday meals, not just a weekend luxury. That’s why we keep our prices fair and our cuts versatile, with options for quick cooking, slow roasting or barbecue favourites. Everything is handled on-site with care, and we’re always happy to prepare to order or offer cooking tips if you’re trying something new. Seafood Our fresh seafood selection is sourced from the clear, pristine waters of Western Australia. We work closely with Ricciardis, who fish using sustainable methods that protect local marine life and preserve quality. Expect fillets, whole fish, prawns and seasonal favourites. It’s all delivered fresh, not frozen. Ready to cook and always top quality. We stock a rotating selection that follows the local catch. That means the offer changes through the week, depending on what’s abundant and at its best. From snapper and salmon to squid and octopus, everything is sold by weight with clear pricing and help on hand. We can also fillet to order or offer serving suggestions for entertaining and home cooking. Groceries We have everything you need to fill your pantry with everyday staples and hard-to-find ingredients. You’ll find a growing range of gourmet WA products, imported favourites and low-sugar or gluten-free items. From flour and sauces to snacks, condiments and oils, this is a grocery aisle that brings more to your table. We aim to make shopping more thoughtful without making it complicated. That’s why our shelves include a mix of trusted basics and unexpected favourites. Whether you need to grab a last-minute pasta sauce or want to try something new for dinner, you’ll find clear labelling, regular specials and a team that knows the range. If we don’t have it, we’ll try to source it. Coffee and Deli Grab your morning caffeine or something tasty from the deli. Our baristas serve coffee made with freshly roasted beans from BREW coffee roasters. At the counter, you’ll find deli meats, fresh dips, cheese and antipasti that turn a simple lunch or platter into something more special. Whether it’s a sandwich, a salad box or a treat for later, the café and deli are here when you need them. We also offer light eats to go, including toasted sandwiches, focaccias and weekend favourites like ham and cheese croissants. It’s a space to slow down, refuel or grab something in a rush. And if you’re planning a gathering, we can help you build a grazing board with deli cheeses, cured meats, olives and fresh extras from the store. Ready Made Meals Our ready made range is fresh, fast and full of flavour. With meals made in-house daily, you’ll find options for lunch, dinner or something in between. Fresh pasta, salads, poke bowls, flatbread pizzas and heat-and-eat dinners are ready to go when time is tight. It’s convenient without compromise and a great way to feed the family on the move. Each item is labelled with ingredients and use-by dates, so you can shop confidently. You’ll also find vegetarian, gluten-free and dairy-free options in the mix. New meals are added regularly, and many are inspired by seasonal produce or WA flavours. Whether you’re rushing between school runs or just want a night off cooking, it’s all sorted here. Fresh Juice Bar Choose from a range of freshly pressed juices and smoothies made using the same fruit and veg we stock. Seasonal blends are on rotation with custom options available. It’s a healthy way to start the day or a refreshing pick-me-up while you shop. Our juice bar is a local favourite for a reason. You’ll find cold-pressed combinations that pack in nutrients, with no added sugar or filler. From green juices to fruit-forward mixes, everything is made to order. Add protein or ginger for a boost, or ask the team to create a blend based on your favourites. We bottle in store too, so you can grab and go. Organic Products We’re committed to stocking high quality organic food for the whole family. Our organic section includes fresh produce, dry goods, snacks and essentials. Organic fruit and veg is clearly labelled and rotated regularly to keep everything crisp and seasonal. It’s part of our promise to support local growers and help you shop well with less effort. We’ve expanded this section to include certified organic grocery items, from grains and cereals to oils, baby food and household basics. You’ll also find local WA organic brands featured alongside national names. If you’re making the switch to organic or looking to avoid additives and sprays, we’ve made it easier to shop with confidence. Come and meet our staff Our team is here to make shopping easier. Whether you’re looking for something new, need help preparing a meal or want to know what’s freshest today, just ask. We’re proud of our range and we’re happy to chat about how to get the most from it. Come say hello next time you’re in store. We value relationships, not just transactions. That’s why many of our regulars know our team by name, and vice versa. From the produce aisle to the butcher counter, we’re always happy to explain where something comes from, how to cook it or what might go well with it. It’s a grocery store that still feels like a community. Come Visit Us Our Range We’re open seven days a week from 7am to 7pm with a full fresh offer, ready made meals and daily grocery essentials all under one roof. Shop fresh, shop local and take home food you’ll feel good about serving. Malibu Market acknowledges the Traditional Custodians of the land on which we operate, including the Whadjuk Noongar people. We pay our respects to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples across Australia. Respect, quality and local support are values at the heart of what we do. Come visit us at the Malibu Shopping Complex in Safety Bay. Whether you’re stopping in for tonight’s dinner or stocking the pantry, you’ll find fresh food, friendly faces and everything you need in one easy shop. Our Range Menu",

Here’s a simple guide to get soft, gooey cinnamon rolls that everyone will love. Ingredients: 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour 1\/4 cup sugar 1 packet active dry yeast 1\/2 cup milk 1\/4 cup butter (melted) 1 egg 1\/2 teaspoon salt 1\/2 cup brown sugar 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon Step 1: Prepare the Dough In a small bowl, warm the milk to about 110°F. Add sugar and active dry yeast to the milk. Stir and let it sit for 5 minutes until it becomes frothy. This step activates the yeast. In a larger bowl, combine flour and salt . Add the yeast mixture, melted butter , and egg . Mix until a dough forms. Step 2: Knead the Dough Place the dough on a floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes. This makes the dough smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour. Step 3: First Rise Place the dough in a greased bowl. Cover it with a clean towel and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour. It should double in size. Step 4: Roll Out the Dough Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release air. Roll the dough into a rectangle, about 12×9 inches. Step 5: Add Cinnamon Filling Spread melted butter over the rolled dough. Mix brown sugar and cinnamon together, then sprinkle the mixture evenly over the buttered dough. Step 6: Roll and Slice Starting from the long side, carefully roll the dough into a tight log. Slice the rolled dough into 12 even pieces. Place them in a greased baking dish, leaving a little space between each roll. Step 7: Second Rise Cover the rolls and let them rise for another 30 minutes. This helps them become soft and fluffy. Step 8: Bake Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) . Bake the rolls for 20-25 minutes or until they are golden brown on top. Step 9: Add Icing While the rolls bake, make the icing by mixing powdered sugar , a little milk , and vanilla extract . Once the rolls are done, drizzle the icing over the hot rolls. Tips for Perfect Cinnamon Rolls: Let the dough rise properly : Don’t rush the rising process. Use fresh yeast : This ensures the dough will rise well. Don’t overfill the rolls : Use the right amount of filling to prevent a mess. With this simple method, you’ll have perfect cinnamon rolls that are soft, sweet, and gooey—just like the ones from a bakery. Enjoy them fresh from the oven! The Secret to Making Fluffy Dinner Rolls November 28, 2024 No Comments Making fluffy dinner rolls is simple with the right approach. Here’s a clear and easy method to create soft, airy rolls every time. What You Need: 2 cups of all-purpose flour 1\/4 cup of sugar 1\/4 cup of butter 1\/2 cup of warm milk 1 packet of active dry yeast 1 teaspoon of salt 1 egg Step 1: Activate the Yeast In a small bowl, mix warm milk (about 110°F) with sugar . Stir in active dry yeast and let it sit for 5 minutes. The yeast should become bubbly and frothy. This step ensures the yeast is active and ready to help the dough rise. Step 2: Mix the Dough In a large bowl, combine flour and salt . Add the activated yeast mixture, melted butter , and egg . Stir the ingredients together until a dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour, one tablespoon at a time. Step 3: Knead the Dough Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface. Knead it for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Kneading helps develop the gluten, which is key to making the rolls fluffy. Step 4: Let the Dough Rise Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl and cover it with a clean towel. Let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until it has doubled in size. This rise gives the rolls their airy texture. Step 5: Shape the Rolls Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release the air. Divide the dough into 12 equal portions and shape them into balls. Arrange the balls in a greased baking pan, leaving a little space between each one. Step 6: Second Rise Cover the pan with a towel and let the dough rise for another 30 minutes . This second rise helps the rolls become light and fluffy. Step 7: Bake Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) . Bake the rolls for about 20 minutes , or until the tops are golden brown. Step 8: Brush with Butter Once the rolls are done, remove them from the oven and brush the tops with melted butter. This adds flavor and keeps the rolls soft. Tips for Fluffy Rolls: Don’t overwork the dough : Knead just enough to form a smooth texture. Use fresh yeast : Ensure your yeast is not expired for the best rise. Let the dough rise properly : Give it enough time to double in size. With this simple method, you can make soft, fluffy dinner rolls that will impress everyone at the table. Just follow the steps, and you’ll have perfect rolls every time. How to Bake Bread in a Dutch Oven for a Crispy Crust November 28, 2024 No Comments Baking bread in a Dutch oven is one of the easiest ways to achieve a perfect, crispy crust at home. The heavy lid of the Dutch oven traps steam, which helps the bread rise and develop a golden, crunchy exterior. Here’s a simple guide to baking bread in a Dutch oven. What You Need Dutch oven (5-6 quarts) Bread dough (your choice of recipe) Parchment paper Oven mitts Sharp knife or bread lame Step 1: Prepare the Dough Start by preparing your bread dough. Whether you’re making a simple white loaf, sourdough, or another type, allow it to rise as per your recipe. After the dough has risen, punch it down to remove excess air and shape it into a round or oval form. Let it rest for a few minutes before baking. Step 2: Preheat the Dutch Oven Place your Dutch oven with the lid on inside the oven. Preheat the oven to 450°F (232°C) . The Dutch oven needs to be hot before you add the dough to ensure a crisp crust. Let it heat for at least 30 minutes. Step 3: Place the Dough in the Dutch Oven Once the Dutch oven is hot, carefully remove it from the oven using oven mitts. Line the bottom of the Dutch oven with parchment paper to prevent the dough from sticking. Place the shaped dough on top of the parchment paper inside the Dutch oven. Step 4: Score the Dough Before baking, make a few shallow slashes on the top of the dough using a sharp knife or bread lame. This step allows the dough to expand evenly as it bakes, creating a beautiful pattern and enhancing the final crust. Step 5: Bake with the Lid On Place the lid back on the Dutch oven and return it to the oven. Bake for 30 minutes with the lid on. This traps the steam, helping the dough rise and creating a soft, moist interior. Step 6: Bake with the Lid Off After 30 minutes, remove the lid and continue baking for another 15-20 minutes , or until the crust is golden brown and crispy. This last step allows the bread to develop a crunchy exterior. Step 7: Cool the Bread Once the bread is fully baked, remove it from the Dutch oven and let it cool on a wire rack. This helps the bread finish cooking and prevents it from becoming soggy. Tips for Success: Use a high hydration dough (with more water) for a softer, airier interior and a crispier crust. Keep the oven temperature consistent for best results. If your bread sticks to the parchment paper, lightly flour it before placing the dough. By baking your bread in a Dutch oven, you create an environment that mimics a professional bakery oven, resulting in a deliciously crispy crust and a soft, fluffy interior. This method is simple and effective, perfect for any home baker looking to improve their bread baking skills. Spotlight on Sunshine Coast’s French Pastries: Croissants, Éclairs, and More November 4, 2024 No Comments There’s something undeniably charming about indulging in a French pastry, especially here on the Sunshine Coast, where local bakeries have mastered the art of bringing a little slice of France to our sandy shores. As a self-confessed pastry lover, I find myself drawn to these local spots, craving that perfect combination of flaky, buttery layers and rich, creamy fillings that only the finest French pastries can deliver. Today, I want to share my experiences of discovering some of the best French-style bakeries and patisseries around the Sunshine Coast. From croissants that shatter with every bite to éclairs filled with velvety cream, there’s no shortage of deliciousness here, and each bakery has its unique twist on French tradition. My First Taste: Croissants Done Right Whenever I walk into a bakery, the first thing that usually catches my eye (and my heart) is the croissant display. A true croissant, in my opinion, needs to be golden, slightly crisp on the outside, with an irresistible buttery aroma. One of my favorite places to start my morning is at Le Petite Patisserie , a quaint bakery in the heart of the Sunshine Coast that has perfected the art of the croissant. At Le Petite Patisserie , their croissants are everything you’d want from a traditional French pastry. Biting into one of their almond croissants is like tasting a piece of Paris—flaky, nutty, and delicately sweet. There’s a special attention to detail here; I could tell they use quality ingredients, and their skill in handling dough shows in every layered bite. For me, a cup of coffee and one of their almond croissants is the perfect start to a lazy weekend morning. I’m also a fan of their pain au chocolat . Each one has just the right amount of rich, dark chocolate tucked inside, with that essential balance between the sweet filling and the buttery, slightly savory dough. I appreciate that this bakery respects the traditional recipe but adds a Sunshine Coast twist by using locally sourced butter, giving the pastries a freshness that’s hard to beat. The Delicate Art of Éclairs Moving from croissants to éclairs was a natural next step in my French pastry journey. The éclairs I’ve found here are nothing short of spectacular. I remember the first time I stumbled upon Pâtisserie Jolie , a hidden gem that specializes in éclairs. Walking in, I was greeted by a vibrant array of pastries in every color imaginable—vanilla bean éclairs topped with delicate white glaze, chocolate éclairs with a deep, rich ganache, and even seasonal fruit éclairs that make the most of local produce. The classic chocolate éclair at Pâtisserie Jolie is something I’d recommend to anyone with a sweet tooth. Their pâte à choux is light and airy, and the filling is velvety smooth, made with real chocolate rather than an overly sweet synthetic filling. It’s the kind of éclair you take your time savoring, letting each bite melt in your mouth. One éclair here, and I was hooked. For a unique twist, they also offer a passionfruit éclair that’s truly unforgettable. The tangy sweetness of the passionfruit custard inside perfectly complements the sweetness of the pastry. It’s bright, bold, and feels very much in tune with the Sunshine Coast’s tropical vibes. Every time I visit, I try to leave with a box of different flavors, but I always end up going back for more. Tarts, Macarons, and More Of course, no French pastry experience would be complete without tarts and macarons. I found my go-to place for these treats at Belle’s French Bakery , where they take pastry-making to an entirely new level. Their fruit tarts are a visual delight: imagine fresh berries glistening on top of creamy custard, all nestled in a perfectly baked, buttery tart shell. One of my absolute favorites at Belle’s is their lemon tart. It’s tangy without being too sharp, with just the right amount of sweetness to balance out the flavors. The custard is smooth and silky, while the tart shell adds a satisfying crunch. Paired with a latte, this tart makes for an indulgent afternoon treat. Their macarons, too, are little bites of heaven. The flavors range from classics like pistachio and raspberry to more adventurous options like salted caramel and lavender. The salted caramel macaron is a must-try; it’s sweet with a hint of salt, which brings out the caramel notes even more. For anyone who loves macarons, this bakery offers an impressive selection that would make any Parisian patisserie proud. Seasonal French Pastries: Local Ingredients with a French Twist One thing I love about the Sunshine Coast’s French-inspired bakeries is how they incorporate seasonal ingredients into their offerings. It’s common to find pastries that feature tropical fruits like mango, passionfruit, and even native Australian ingredients such as finger lime. These additions create a unique fusion, respecting French pastry traditions while embracing our local flavors. A seasonal favorite of mine is the tropical fruit mille-feuille from Pâtisserie Jolie . Mille-feuille, also known as the “thousand-layer” pastry, traditionally layers puff pastry with cream or custard. This bakery’s twist includes a layer of mango cream, which gives it a fruity sweetness that’s refreshing and indulgent at the same time. The result is a dessert that feels light yet decadent, perfect for a warm Sunshine Coast afternoon. Another standout is the macadamia praline éclair. Using macadamias, a nut native to Australia, as a topping brings out a nutty sweetness that pairs beautifully with the smooth cream filling. This éclair feels special, like a nod to both French tradition and our local Sunshine Coast heritage. Why French Pastries Are a Must-Try on the Sunshine Coast For me, French pastries are more than just desserts; they’re an experience. Each one is crafted with care, from the precision of the dough to the quality of the filling, and every bite brings a touch of luxury to everyday life. Here on the Sunshine Coast, I’m grateful that these bakeries put so much passion into their work, creating pastries that allow us to experience a bit of French culinary art. Exploring these bakeries has added a new dimension to my weekends, whether I’m grabbing a croissant to go, savoring an éclair over coffee, or bringing home a box of macarons to share. If you’re a fan of French pastries—or if you’re simply looking to treat yourself—I encourage you to explore the Sunshine Coast’s many patisseries. Each one offers its own take on classic French recipes, and the only thing better than discovering these places is indulging in their creations. For now, I’m content to keep exploring, savoring each buttery bite, each sweet filling, and each crispy, flaky layer that makes French pastries so special. And with so many wonderful options here on the Sunshine Coast, I have a feeling I’ll be enjoying these treats for years to come.

The Dreaming describes the journey of a group of women of all ages who travelled east gathering food, collecting Ngalyipi (Tinospora smilacina or snake vine) and performing ceremonies as they travelled. The women began their journey at Mina Mina where Karlangu (digging sticks) emerged from the ground. Taking these implements the women travelled east creating Janyinki and other sites. Their journey took them eventually beyond Warlpiri country. In contemporary Warlpiri paintings traditional iconography is used to represent the Jukurrpa, associated sites and other elements. The primary motif used in paintings of the Jukurrpa are the Karlangu digging sticks which rose up out of the ground at Mina Mina. The women used them to collect bush tucker on their travels. This painting shows the motion of the digging sticks as the women move them to dig. \"Close (esc)\" Julie Woods Two Sisters Xmas Ball Regular price $14.00 10 in stock 7.6cm \"Close (esc)\" BUSH FOOD PAINTINGS, WEAVING & CARVING BEAUTY & BUSH MEDICINE \"Close (esc)\"",

They openly and shamelessly asking for suggestions for improvement, which is fantastic. The motel is opposite Foodland, which makes shopping very accessible, they are also a few restaurants nearby. There is also a common laundry and kitchen at the motel. I enjoy my stay at this motel, mainly thanks for the hospitality of the owners, Mac and her partner.\" Tanya M Tanya M \"Mac and staff have gone out of their way to make my stay enjoyable and comfortable. The added bonus of being pet friendly made it very convenient for me. I am a regular visitor to Port Augusta due to family ties and friends and can confidently say that I will be utilising their warm hospitality again!!!\" Phil McCabe \"There’s nothing like a warm welcome after a long day on the road. I would give the service 6 stars if I could! These guys really went above and beyond to help us out. We were very grateful to find pet friendly, affordable accommodation in the Xmas\/ New Year period. After a long day driving we enjoyed the warm shower (excellent water pressure) and comfortable bed. A little detail that is often missing in hotels - we could sign into our own Netflix to watch some TV! The new owners are putting a lot of work into updating the place. Highly recommend a stay here with your fur baby.\" Snow Du Fau \"Room was perfect for my family, bed very comfy and clean. Well priced. Good location. Staff friendly and happy to have a chat (something that is becoming a rarity these days). Highly recommend.\" Thu Hien Tran \" 5\/5 Very welcoming and friendly staff. Loved that our dog was made welcome. Rooms clean and beds very comfortable. Great location.\" Write your caption here Justine Padovan \"This was my second stay at Motel Poinsettia in the past six months travelling with Fergus the Doberman. Rooms are specious and very clean. Motel is a bit dated but everything is in excellent working order. Only a very short walk ( 3 minutes) to a dog friendly park. Excellent value for money and is my new go to, pet friendly, motel.\" Write your caption here Eugene C \"The service was above and beyond. I arrived very late in the evening without a booking and they still took me in. The room was spacious and very clean. I will stay here next time I'm in Port Augusta.\" Write your caption here Vinnjar Bruknapp \"I stayed in a pet friendly room had a migraine. The hostess was very helpful and friendly. I give this place a high rating as its rare to get such a lovely person who cares. Thank you\" Write your caption here Sky Flyer \"Excellent, very clean and comfortable.

Trays are manually fed to the machine and firstly pass under the bottoms pastry pin and pastry laid and then dragged onto the pie pallet. The pallet then passes under the tray forming station which impresses the pastry into the pie form. The tray emerges from the station and pastry is water misted to allow adhesion of the top pastry when applied. The next step the tray indexes to the depositor station and each tin is filled with a measured quantity of meat. The next process the filled pie pallet travels under the tops pastry pin where tops pastry is laid on top, the pallet then passé through the trim where a pneumatic operated stamper\/plate is pressurised against the pie pallet and the top pastry is crimped against the bottom pastry and trimmed around the pie tin.

The menu has plenty of variety. I can never go past the pork belly entree and the main meals are delicious with large serves. You can sit at tables or at benches and watch the world go by! Thoroughly recommend it. billg63 March 2020 The BEST bar (and Tapas) in Noosa!!! The tapas style food here is some of the best on the coast! Consistently great, high quality and delicious meals \/ bites to eat, at very reasonable prices. The Beef Tataki is outstanding…and if you’re lucky Tuna tataki or sashimi even better! Great pizzas, and pork belly to die for!

Outside of his professional life, Dr. Cian enjoys long walks, exploring Australia’s natural landscapes, and producing music, in addition to cherishing moments with his beloved cat, Honey.

Dishes are a little pricey, but have been consistently excellent and with very attentive service! The inexpensive Zilzie wines are also surprisingly good! 😉👌 Food: 5\/5 Service: 5\/5 Atmosphere: 5\/5 Jamie Grogan This place is a hidden gem. I never understood why it was Always busy until we called in for dinner. Great selection of food to cater for all, including kids. Prices are great and the food wonderful. The place looks a little dated but don't let that hold you back. It has been there forever. Stand-up Guy Best value lunch in town! Twice now I've had the Beef Red Curry with steamed rice, and it's tasty and very well priced - $14 😋 Dined in - table service, but I ordered when I walked in and was eating 10 minutes later. I had the same meal on a previous evening, and $24 then - I think that serve may be a bit larger, but the lunchtime special is still quite generous. Shan McLoughlin Such a great dinner! We ordered the Carnation crispy pork belly, crying tiger wagu beef, and veg spring rolls - so happy with the food and service!

One of the oldest French restaurant in Sydney , we are proud to offer a wide range of traditional favourites, daily specials and an exclusive, extensive list of French wines. Ideal for a quick lunch, business lunches, leisurely dinner or special occasion, such as Valentine’s Day and Bastille Day, you will enjoy a wonderful Parisian atmosphere that can be oh-so-romantic. Please call us today for more information and don’t hesitate to ask about party and group bookings. Our history In 1967 La Guillotine opened as a traditional French omelette house in the basement of 9 Albion Place. Now a Sydney icon, our authentic French restaurant first became extremely popular in the 1970s and has hosted many over the years who will never forget the very red walls, the iron bars in the archways and the Parisian atmosphere, emphasised by Edith Piaf and Charles Aznavour playing in the background. In 2002 the restaurant was reborn inside a converted office building at 518 Kent Street, only a stone’s throw away from the old Albion laneway. Current owner Joseph Bradaric, in his 27th year, has expanded the restaurant while keeping the original intimate feeling alive. The ground floor looks down onto Kent Street and takes in the Sydney street life. We hope you will enjoy La Guillotine as others have for many years. Wonderful menu Centrally located in Sydney, our idyllic French restaurant is close to all public transport, parking, the George Street cinemas and Darling Harbour, with disabled access available. Our menus are available in both French and English and include such favourites as: Omelettes Pate Onion soup Escargot Moules marinières Crepes 518 Kent Street Sydney NSW 2000 Tel: 02 9264 1487 Fax: 02 9264 1428 laguill@bigpond.com View our Menu Make a Booking Privacy Policy Share by:",

Reply from Experience OZ Customer Support Hi Neville, so pleased to see you enjoyed your Outback at Isa, we appreciate the time you have taken to share your experience! V Victoria Vickers over 2 years ago Very knowledgeable presentation from an old-time miner The trip down into the mine was very real. We got to be hands-on with a drill to set a blast. We saw heavy equipment in operation and felt a simulated blasting of the rock wall. This mine is still in operation and pulling our mineral-rich ore and these rock samples were so heavy!

The owner was very friendly. Our room was spotlessly clean. While the motel is positioned at a busy roundabout it did not affect the quality of our sleep. Only a few blocks from town. We were very happy staying here and would again when back in this town\" Great place to stay \"The Overlander Motor Lodge, is a nice place to stay. The units are of a good size with a comfortable bed. The unit was very clean and tidy with great shower pressure in the bathrooms. My son and I use the pool the 3 days that we were there. I would recommend the Overlander as we would stay there again. Andrew\" Fantastic hospitality. \"We were traveling through and decided to stop the night in Gunnedah. We called up and there was only one room left, but it hadn't been cleaned due to a late late checkout. I informed them We have two small children who had been in the car all day so They cleaned it very quickly, the gentleman behind the counter was very accomadating. we were made feel very welcome. The room itself was lovely and spacious. It was very clean and we were the furthest from the road so did not have any noise complaints. I will also add it was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. Will certainly stay again. The only downside was we ran out of hot water in the morning and the cleaners were a little noisey in the morning.\" Boris the \"Golden Retriever\" P.R. Expert \"We go tour a lot and we always stay at the Overlander Gunnedah when heading to Moree and Narrabri etc.. it's clean big size rooms have all you need, pool and more! But best of all we stay to be greeted by Boris the dog a golden retriever he is amazing we love him! We stayed 3 nights good price as well. Best comfy bed by far!!!\" Food very tasty \"We had a very nice queen size room with two comfy armchairs and a table and two chairs. Very comfortable bed, hot shower a good sized flat screen TV on the wall. Parking right outside our door. Mackellar Restaurant is nicely decorated, it's above reception. My husband had fresh oysters and red emperor fish and I had stuffed mushrooms and steak diane, followed by pecan pie. Location is great for travelers but a bit of a walk to centre of town.\" Good size room, comfortable \"Surprisingly a good size room, with 2 x single seater arm chairs. Comfortable bed, wall mounted LCD TV, Tea and coffee facilites, with large mini fridge. Room 12 can be a little noisey, as it is located at the end of the Motel, next to the main road where trucks travel up and down, however this did not affect our sleep quality. Rooms are clean and tidy. Motel is situated on the edge of town, with a 15 minute walk to the main shopping area of Gunnedah. KFC is approx 10 minute walk with McDonalds 20 minutes walk. The Motel also has Fee Wifi (password required from reception), in house resturant and pool. Reception staff are friendly and welcoming.\" © 2019 - OVERLANDER MOTOR LODGE | Website By Update247 Channel Manager",

Know more Find us on Trip Advisor Know more What our customers say about us “ Hands down, the best bakery I've ever been to – and I've been to a lot! The scallop pie and vanilla slice were next level – flaky pastry, so much flavour and a decent size. The old girls on the counter were hilarious – such great service! Highly recommend! Tim Bateup “ They make a fantastic vanilla slice and a really good pepper steak pie, both of which were comparable with the best I had in Tassie. The scallop pie was really good too. There is dining both inside and out and they maintain a busy stream of customers. Wayne T “ With so many delicious looking options making it hard to decide, we finally ordered a Chicken & Camembert pie … The pastry was crisp and fresh, and the filling was delicious … We sat in the courtyard and listened to a nearby harp player (yes, a harp player) while we devoured our morning tea. A very memorable event. Mike Noordermeer “ Best coffee we have had so far in Tasmania was from this bakery! I can see why the vanilla slice has won awards; they have nailed the balance of sweet but not too sweet. Steak pie was amazing! I got one fresh out of the oven. Kaye Eds “ Excellent bakery with all homemade cakes and the quiches are awesome in big or small! The small biscuits are loved by the kids. Really nice outdoor sitting area where the kids can run around and reduce the sugar rush. The coffee is good and the staff is friendly. Lovely stop over in Richmond for a snack or quick lunch!

Awesome staff, clean place and great food!.\" Poy T Granati \"Some of the best Thai good I've had. This is small restaurant serving absolutely amazing dishes.

I’m certainly recommending you to everyone I meet, and promoting Tally Ho to all the people at council who order catering. It was a joy to see your skills, expertise and professionalism unfold last night. The food looked beautiful and tasted wonderful, the food and drinks service stream was perfectly timed, and all the staff handled the night with total professionalism and cooperation from start to clean-up.

I have kept your business card for future reference.” Allan Chandler, President - Coburg District Football Club “Dear Kathy, I am writing to thank you for the beautiful array of food you prepared for my 80th afternoon tea, birthday party. I really appreciated your advice about the choice of food. The chicken meatballs, the sushi and the cheese and spinach rollinis were very popular amongst all ages. The Petit Fours, the slices and the fruit platter were so attractively displayed and were a great choice, especially popular amongst the young people at the party. It was a very happy day partly due to the fact that the food was all organised and so well accepted. Thank you again. I will contact you again if another occasion arises. With best wishes.” Barbara Craig, Satisfied Customer “I am writing to thank you for helping us so much with our 20th Birthday Luncheon on Wednesday 18th May.

Many thanks for all your help.” Gladys Watkins, Hon. Secretary - Probus Ladies Club of Surrey Hills “I just want to thank you for the tremendous job Tally Ho did for us last night.

Thanks again to you and your team!” Barbara Johnston, Norwood Secondary College “Dear Kathy All the family wanted to say thank you for the catering for Pam’s funeral yesterday morning. It truly was a lovely morning tea, as Pam had instructed and lots of our family and friends commented on how good the catering was. We ended up with nearly a hundred guests attending, so the morning tea really helped the conversations after the funeral service. And with the large number of people who came back the house we got through virtually all of the food by the end of the day. Thank you again for your assistance, and we will certainly bear Tally Ho in mind when any of us are organising functions in the future.” Rob Gebert, Arts Consultancy and Creative Projects “To Kathy and Staff at Tally Ho Catering I would like to express my thanks to yourself and staff for the superb food and service that you supplied on Saturday at my St Vincent De Paul Commendation. My friends and family all commented on your great food and service. Your staff were very pleasant, and if somebody needed something it was not a problem. The kitchen area was also left spotless. Kathy, yourself and staff are to be commended. I will highly recommend Tally Ho Catering to everyone I know.” Annette Burkhalter, Satisfied Customer “Just to let you know that the lunches yesterday were beautiful.
