The Dreaming describes the journey of a group of women of all ages who travelled east gathering food, collecting Ngalyipi (Tinospora smilacina or snake vine) and performing ceremonies as they travelled. The women began their journey at Mina Mina where Karlangu (digging sticks) emerged from the ground. Taking these implements the women travelled east creating Janyinki and other sites. Their journey took them eventually beyond Warlpiri country. In contemporary Warlpiri paintings traditional iconography is used to represent the Jukurrpa, associated sites and other elements. The primary motif used in paintings of the Jukurrpa are the Karlangu digging sticks which rose up out of the ground at Mina Mina. The women used them to collect bush tucker on their travels. This painting shows the motion of the digging sticks as the women move them to dig. \"Close (esc)\" Julie Woods Two Sisters Xmas Ball Regular price $14.00 10 in stock 7.6cm \"Close (esc)\" BUSH FOOD PAINTINGS, WEAVING & CARVING BEAUTY & BUSH MEDICINE \"Close (esc)\"",

We all always respect elders, male and female, as well as Ngunnawal country itself. They always keep the pathways of their ancestors alive. They walk together as one. We acknowledge the Ngunnawal people as Canberra’s first inhabitants and Traditional Custodians. We recognise the special relationship and connection that Ngunnawal people have with this Country. Prior to the displacement of Ngunnawal people from their land, they were a thriving people whose life and culture was connected unequivocally to this land in a way that only they understand and know and is core to their physical and spiritual being. The segregation of the Ngunnawal people from Culture and Country has had long-lasting, profound, and ongoing health and well-being effects on their life, cultural practices, families, and continuation of their law\/lore. We acknowledge the historic interruption of the Ngunnawal people of Canberra and their surrounding regions. We recognise the significant contribution the Ngunnawal people have played in caring for Country. For time immemorial they have maintained a tangible and intangible cultural, social, environmental, spiritual, and economic connection to these lands and waters.

I'll see you very soon for my morning wake up coffee :) Brock P 5 Star Google Review Best bakery around with hit-the-spot almond lattes, delicious Veggie Burrito bowls (with a wicked secret relish), and way too many other scrumptiously tempting baked goods. Spinach & Feta rolls, almonds croissants, decadent donuts and gluten free pastries. God get me outta here before I do something I shouldn't. It's probably a good thing I didn't find this place sooner. Felicity W 5 Star Google Review OH MY WORD!!! Behave Fuel Bakehouse!! Youâre food and coffee is DELISH!!!!

Our philosophy is a reflection of our appreciation for the simple things in life, from that first cup in the morning, to good times spent with those closest to you. Sitting down for a cup with friends to manufacture your next moments is what we’re all about. No, we aren’t talking about those big moments you see in photo albums years later, but the ones that happen in-between; the ones you remember. You see, we like to think good coffee has the ability to bring people together and slow life down for a minute, so that you can hatch your next adventure.

Thoroughly recommend it. billg63 March 2020 The BEST bar (and Tapas) in Noosa!!! The tapas style food here is some of the best on the coast! Consistently great, high quality and delicious meals \/ bites to eat, at very reasonable prices. The Beef Tataki is outstanding…and if you’re lucky Tuna tataki or sashimi even better!

Through the conversation, I came to aware that they just bought the place around 2 months ago, and very keen to make customer experience better. They openly and shamelessly asking for suggestions for improvement, which is fantastic. The motel is opposite Foodland, which makes shopping very accessible, they are also a few restaurants nearby. There is also a common laundry and kitchen at the motel. I enjoy my stay at this motel, mainly thanks for the hospitality of the owners, Mac and her partner.\" Tanya M Tanya M \"Mac and staff have gone out of their way to make my stay enjoyable and comfortable. The added bonus of being pet friendly made it very convenient for me. I am a regular visitor to Port Augusta due to family ties and friends and can confidently say that I will be utilising their warm hospitality again!!!\" Phil McCabe \"There’s nothing like a warm welcome after a long day on the road. I would give the service 6 stars if I could! These guys really went above and beyond to help us out. We were very grateful to find pet friendly, affordable accommodation in the Xmas\/ New Year period. After a long day driving we enjoyed the warm shower (excellent water pressure) and comfortable bed. A little detail that is often missing in hotels - we could sign into our own Netflix to watch some TV! The new owners are putting a lot of work into updating the place. Highly recommend a stay here with your fur baby.\" Snow Du Fau \"Room was perfect for my family, bed very comfy and clean. Well priced. Good location. Staff friendly and happy to have a chat (something that is becoming a rarity these days). Highly recommend.\" Thu Hien Tran \" 5\/5 Very welcoming and friendly staff. Loved that our dog was made welcome. Rooms clean and beds very comfortable. Great location.\" Write your caption here Justine Padovan \"This was my second stay at Motel Poinsettia in the past six months travelling with Fergus the Doberman. Rooms are specious and very clean. Motel is a bit dated but everything is in excellent working order. Only a very short walk ( 3 minutes) to a dog friendly park. Excellent value for money and is my new go to, pet friendly, motel.\" Write your caption here Eugene C \"The service was above and beyond. I arrived very late in the evening without a booking and they still took me in. The room was spacious and very clean. I will stay here next time I'm in Port Augusta.\" Write your caption here Vinnjar Bruknapp \"I stayed in a pet friendly room had a migraine. The hostess was very helpful and friendly.

I get sick all the time, and it's such a relief not having to deal with the hassle of scheduling a doctor’s appointment or figuring out insurance every time I need to check on something. This is a much more affordable and convenient option. A Annabelle N. Texas I ordered an STD test and was able to get it done the same day. So much better than having to sit around and stress while waiting to get in to see a doc and for the results. The whole process was super quick and easy. I’ll definitely be using this service again. A Armando D. Texas I'm older, so getting out of the house isn’t always easy for me. Being able to order a test online without needing to go through my doctor made things so much easier. Thelabcafe.com has been a real help. I’ll absolutely be using it again. C Cindy M. Florida FAQs Do You Have Any Questions? View More More Questions? Reach out to us",

I love that I am known by name and coffee order remembered 🥰 makes you feel all special. VIP status kinda deal 😅 Keep up the amazing work x Rae Rhia Lee I absolutely loved this place! The staff, food, and ambience were all fantastic. Unfortunately, I couldn’t finish my meal because I wasn’t feeling well, and I still regret leaving it, haha. I’ll definitely visit again the next time I’m in Ballarat! Sandali Mudalige Popped in for a quick breakfast at approximately 10am on a Sunday. Premises was approximately half full. Great local decor. Staff were friendly and helpful, even apologies when they put the wrong drink in front of the wrong person (no big deal). Extensive menu and diverse menu. Food was both tasty and well presented. My smoothie, passionana, Axeman’s Fishing Adventures My favourite café in Ballarat! The coffee is consistently great, and I love their smashed avo – always spot on. The staff are warm, friendly, and super efficient, which makes every visit a pleasure. There’s plenty of seating, so it’s easy to relax and enjoy your time. Highly recommend!

Reviews Konrad Marshall, The Good Weekend 4 February 2017 View PDF Previous Next Program Wednesday, 30 November 2016, 5-6.30 pm One Step Closer New international initiatives to prohibit nuclear weapons On 27 October the United Nations General Assembly adopted a landmark resolution to launch negotiations on a treaty outlawing nuclear weapons. 123 nations voted in favour of the resolution (Austria was among the co-sponsors). Yet, most nuclear-armed nations voted against the UN resolution as did most of their allies, including nearly all NATO members. Australia also voted against the resolution. An expert panel will give an overview of the efforts which led to this new initiative and analyse the resolution in view of future negotiations in 2017 for a legally binding instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons, leading towards their total elimination. Panelists: Dr Phoebe Wynn-Pope , Director of Humanitarian Law and Movement, Relations, Australian Red Cross Dr Bernhard Zimburg , Ambassador Austrian Embassy Canberra Prof Richard Tanter , School of Political and Social Studies at the University of Melbourne Assoc. Prof. Dr Tilman Ruff , Co-president of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War Tim Wright , Asia-Pacific Director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) Moderate: Bishop Philip Huggins , Oodthenong area of episcopal car e Sunday 4 December 2016, 3 pm Official Exhibition Opening Saturday, 10 December 2016, 11 am Guided tour with the curator An overview of artwork in the exhibition with exhibition curator JD Mittmann and an insight in the artistic responses to the British atomic tests in Australia 60 years ago. Saturday, 10 December 2016, 2 pm Author Liz Tynan launches her book “Atomic Thunder – The Maralinga Story” In 1950 Australian prime minister Robert Menzies blithely agreed to atomic tests in Australia and relinquished control over them. In this new book Journalist and academic Elizabeth Tynan reveals the devastating consequences of that decision, and how Maralinga has continued to be shrouded in mystery decades after the atomic thunder stopped rolling across the South Australian test site. www.newsouthbooks.com.au\/books\/atomic-thunder\/ Film Screenings at M.A.D.E. Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka, Ballarat Sunday, 11 December 2016, 1 pm Backs to the Blast: An Australian Nuclear Story Dir. Harry Bardwell 52 min, Australia 1981 A documentary history of the uranium and nuclear industry in South Australia from 1910 to 1980. Incorporates rare archival footage and contemporary interviews with workers, scientists and politicians, presenting an analysis of the effects of uranium and its products. Provides a detailed examination of the uranium mine at Radium Hill, the uranium oxide refinery at Port Pirie and the British atomic weapons test site at Maralinga. Sunday, 18 December 2016, 1 pm Silent Storm Dir. Peter Butt 52 min, Australia 2003 Set against a backdrop of the Cold War, the saga follows scientist Hedley Marston’s attempt to blow the whistle on radioactive fallout from the British atomic tests in Australia. His claims that cities and grazing lands were contaminated and that Strontium 90 was in the milk supply were disputed, but the government’s own bone surveys proved his assertion right. Sunday, 15 January 2017, 1 pm Half Life: A Parable for the Nuclear Age Dir. Dennis O’Rourke 84 min, Australia 1985 Between 1946 and 1958 the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission exploded at least 66 nuclear devices in the Marshall Islands, contaminating them for centuries to come. This film is about the devastating effects of radiation on the islanders. In the course of his investigations, the filmmaker found that the official view of the tests was unsustainable. Won the Peace Film Award in 1986 at the Berlin International Film Festival. Sunday, 22 January 2017, 1 pm Nobody told us anything Dir. Charles Stewart 96 min, United Kingdom 2014 Between 1952 and 1967, in the largest Tri-Service operation since the D-Day landings, over 20,000 servicemen participated in British Nuclear Weapons Tests. The 2011 British Nuclear Test Veterans Health Needs Audit shows that a daunting shadow still hangs over the Veterans. This documentary tells that story in archive footage and candid interviews with the survivors and their children. Sunday, 29 January 2017, 1 pm Australian Atomic Confessions (with film maker Kathy Aigner) Dir. Gregory K. Young 50 min, Australia 2005 Documentary about the compelling story of the 12 British atomic bomb tests in the 1950s, discussed by Aboriginal elders, veterans, experts and the premier of South Australia. With the building of a new 500 million dollar nuclear reactor in a Sydney suburb, the expansion of more multi-national uranium mines and the associated poisoning of the Great Artesian Basin, reflecting about nuclear energy uses is now as important as ever.

    "homepage_content":"Café Corretto – Italian restaurant Skip to content Menu CAFFE CORRETTO HISTORY The Francese family opened their first restaurant in 1971 in Melbourne, Australia. It was an instant success thanks to their authentic Italian home-style pizza and pasta, paired with warm, friendly service. Over the years, the Francese family has developed a unique Italian dining experience rooted in generations of cherished family recipes from Southern Italy. Caffè Corretto opened its doors in 1972 on the iconic Lygon Street in Carlton. Since then, it has become known for its exceptional Corretto Pizza, handmade pasta, signature parmigiana, and sizzling charcoal-grilled steaks packed with bold, unforgettable flavour. The restaurant’s vibrant atmosphere and welcoming spirit have made it a beloved destination for locals and visitors alike.

The inexpensive Zilzie wines are also surprisingly good! 😉👌 Food: 5\/5 Service: 5\/5 Atmosphere: 5\/5 Jamie Grogan This place is a hidden gem. I never understood why it was Always busy until we called in for dinner. Great selection of food to cater for all, including kids. Prices are great and the food wonderful. The place looks a little dated but don't let that hold you back. It has been there forever. Stand-up Guy Best value lunch in town! Twice now I've had the Beef Red Curry with steamed rice, and it's tasty and very well priced - $14 😋 Dined in - table service, but I ordered when I walked in and was eating 10 minutes later. I had the same meal on a previous evening, and $24 then - I think that serve may be a bit larger, but the lunchtime special is still quite generous. Shan McLoughlin Such a great dinner! We ordered the Carnation crispy pork belly, crying tiger wagu beef, and veg spring rolls - so happy with the food and service!

Dishes are a little pricey, but have been consistently excellent and with very attentive service! The inexpensive Zilzie wines are also surprisingly good! 😉👌 Food: 5\/5 Service: 5\/5 Atmosphere: 5\/5 Jamie Grogan This place is a hidden gem. I never understood why it was Always busy until we called in for dinner. Great selection of food to cater for all, including kids. Prices are great and the food wonderful. The place looks a little dated but don't let that hold you back. It has been there forever. Stand-up Guy Best value lunch in town! Twice now I've had the Beef Red Curry with steamed rice, and it's tasty and very well priced - $14 😋 Dined in - table service, but I ordered when I walked in and was eating 10 minutes later. I had the same meal on a previous evening, and $24 then - I think that serve may be a bit larger, but the lunchtime special is still quite generous. Shan McLoughlin Such a great dinner! We ordered the Carnation crispy pork belly, crying tiger wagu beef, and veg spring rolls - so happy with the food and service! Even though it was busy, we were served quickly, our drinks arrived quickly, and we were asked if we were ready for our mains. write us a review Takeaway Food & Delivery TAKEAWAY FOOD & DELIVERY Looking for food delivery in wollongong ?

Access via Crafers open at all times. Access via Greenhill Rd may vary. For road closure information. Dismiss National Parks and Wildlife Service South Australia The Barking Gecko Café The Barking Gecko Café is open daily from 9:30am - 5:00pm (food served 10.00 – 4.00 and coffee 9.30 – 4.30). Entry to the café is free if not entering the wildlife park. We serve a seasonal menu and pride ourselves on sourcing products from the Adelaide Hills. You can grab light lunch or sit down to a delicious hot meal, pairing it with a fresh roasted coffee, or a glass of wine. We’ve even got a kids menu to keep the little ones happy. In hot weather, it’s always that little bit cooler in the Adelaide Hills. Soak up the sunshine in the leafy café garden. You’ll see Superb Blue Wrens and potoroos, and if you’re on the garden lawn at 12.45pm, you’ll catch the Garden Dwellers keeper talk! In winter you can warm up next to our wood fire. The Barking Gecko Café can also host your next corporate lunch or afternoon tea. Find out about our catering packages Read our café menu here Sustainability Commitment: The Barking Gecko Café not only takes pride in providing outstanding food and service, but also supporting our environment. Since 2019 the café has demonstrated best practice in sustainability and proud to be completely landfill free. Actions that we have used to achieve sustainable and landfill free business park wide: We use a commercial local family owned green waste service to divert all waste to become a commercial compost. Our staff educate our visitors about our commitment to divert and sort waste. Any waste that slips though the green or recycle bins are then diverted to become a fuel to power an Adelaide cement business. All takeaway cups, containers, cutlery, and all plastics used in the kitchen are compostable plastic (PLA) made from plants. All single-use refundable plastic bottles, plastic milk bottles and non-refundable plastic containers are separated by staff and sent to Scouts Recycling. PET and milk bottle lids, plastic rings are cut off and recycled in domestic recycle bins. Plastic rings are also snipped so they’re not a threat to wildlife. We have an active worm farm that food scraps are used for, the worms are then used to feed animals within the Park. Such initiatives are only possible through the commitment of all the café staff and have proven so successful the café now features in our education packages on how to operate a sustainable food business!

Reply from Experience OZ Customer Support Hi Neville, so pleased to see you enjoyed your Outback at Isa, we appreciate the time you have taken to share your experience! V Victoria Vickers over 2 years ago Very knowledgeable presentation from an old-time miner The trip down into the mine was very real. We got to be hands-on with a drill to set a blast. We saw heavy equipment in operation and felt a simulated blasting of the rock wall. This mine is still in operation and pulling our mineral-rich ore and these rock samples were so heavy!

One of the oldest French restaurant in Sydney , we are proud to offer a wide range of traditional favourites, daily specials and an exclusive, extensive list of French wines. Ideal for a quick lunch, business lunches, leisurely dinner or special occasion, such as Valentine’s Day and Bastille Day, you will enjoy a wonderful Parisian atmosphere that can be oh-so-romantic. Please call us today for more information and don’t hesitate to ask about party and group bookings. Our history In 1967 La Guillotine opened as a traditional French omelette house in the basement of 9 Albion Place. Now a Sydney icon, our authentic French restaurant first became extremely popular in the 1970s and has hosted many over the years who will never forget the very red walls, the iron bars in the archways and the Parisian atmosphere, emphasised by Edith Piaf and Charles Aznavour playing in the background. In 2002 the restaurant was reborn inside a converted office building at 518 Kent Street, only a stone’s throw away from the old Albion laneway. Current owner Joseph Bradaric, in his 27th year, has expanded the restaurant while keeping the original intimate feeling alive. The ground floor looks down onto Kent Street and takes in the Sydney street life. We hope you will enjoy La Guillotine as others have for many years. Wonderful menu Centrally located in Sydney, our idyllic French restaurant is close to all public transport, parking, the George Street cinemas and Darling Harbour, with disabled access available. Our menus are available in both French and English and include such favourites as: Omelettes Pate Onion soup Escargot Moules marinières Crepes 518 Kent Street Sydney NSW 2000 Tel: 02 9264 1487 Fax: 02 9264 1428 laguill@bigpond.com View our Menu Make a Booking Privacy Policy Share by:",

They debate about things like the best variety of spud, whether they should plant onion or carrots in a particular field. Thanks to their love of their family farm business, it has grown from being a small potato supplier to local shops to a grower, packer and distributor to retailers nationwide. ​ Philip Sr. believes that bringing people good quality food to eat is as noble a vocation as there is.

The owner was very friendly. Our room was spotlessly clean. While the motel is positioned at a busy roundabout it did not affect the quality of our sleep. Only a few blocks from town. We were very happy staying here and would again when back in this town\" Great place to stay \"The Overlander Motor Lodge, is a nice place to stay. The units are of a good size with a comfortable bed. The unit was very clean and tidy with great shower pressure in the bathrooms. My son and I use the pool the 3 days that we were there. I would recommend the Overlander as we would stay there again. Andrew\" Fantastic hospitality. \"We were traveling through and decided to stop the night in Gunnedah. We called up and there was only one room left, but it hadn't been cleaned due to a late late checkout. I informed them We have two small children who had been in the car all day so They cleaned it very quickly, the gentleman behind the counter was very accomadating. we were made feel very welcome. The room itself was lovely and spacious. It was very clean and we were the furthest from the road so did not have any noise complaints. I will also add it was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. Will certainly stay again. The only downside was we ran out of hot water in the morning and the cleaners were a little noisey in the morning.\" Boris the \"Golden Retriever\" P.R. Expert \"We go tour a lot and we always stay at the Overlander Gunnedah when heading to Moree and Narrabri etc.. it's clean big size rooms have all you need, pool and more! But best of all we stay to be greeted by Boris the dog a golden retriever he is amazing we love him! We stayed 3 nights good price as well. Best comfy bed by far!!!\" Food very tasty \"We had a very nice queen size room with two comfy armchairs and a table and two chairs. Very comfortable bed, hot shower a good sized flat screen TV on the wall. Parking right outside our door. Mackellar Restaurant is nicely decorated, it's above reception. My husband had fresh oysters and red emperor fish and I had stuffed mushrooms and steak diane, followed by pecan pie. Location is great for travelers but a bit of a walk to centre of town.\" Good size room, comfortable \"Surprisingly a good size room, with 2 x single seater arm chairs. Comfortable bed, wall mounted LCD TV, Tea and coffee facilites, with large mini fridge. Room 12 can be a little noisey, as it is located at the end of the Motel, next to the main road where trucks travel up and down, however this did not affect our sleep quality. Rooms are clean and tidy. Motel is situated on the edge of town, with a 15 minute walk to the main shopping area of Gunnedah. KFC is approx 10 minute walk with McDonalds 20 minutes walk. The Motel also has Fee Wifi (password required from reception), in house resturant and pool. Reception staff are friendly and welcoming.\" © 2019 - OVERLANDER MOTOR LODGE | Website By Update247 Channel Manager",

Rubina Mahat 2 months ago Have been going here for years and its still as delicious. The only manoosh ill eat! Wafaa Rifai 2 months ago have been with this place since 2003, when I was young, at that time this place was called “Aladdin Bakery” which was only one middle east bakery cuisine in Greenacre. I have pretty much had everyday from this place when I was young, since Lam Bagini with cheese and cheese fataya were two my favourite menus. I can say the Oven Bake is the best middle east bakery in Sydney. They have more than 30 years reputation, and now transformed with the modern interior and style, yet the taste has been well preserved since then. If you are a fan of Manoush and Pizza, this place is a Must! Definitely more than 5-google-star rating!! Joshua Kim 2 months ago This bakery stands out from the rest! The staff are very friendly. The place is very clean and organised. The food is amazing! The meat Manoush is the best. The Nutella pizza had an outrageous amount of Nutella and it was to die for! This food is very affordable as well! I recommend anyone to come here for breakfast, brunch or lunch! Honestly Amazing!!!

Know more Find us on Trip Advisor Know more What our customers say about us “ Hands down, the best bakery I've ever been to – and I've been to a lot! The scallop pie and vanilla slice were next level – flaky pastry, so much flavour and a decent size. The old girls on the counter were hilarious – such great service! Highly recommend! Tim Bateup “ They make a fantastic vanilla slice and a really good pepper steak pie, both of which were comparable with the best I had in Tassie. The scallop pie was really good too. There is dining both inside and out and they maintain a busy stream of customers. Wayne T “ With so many delicious looking options making it hard to decide, we finally ordered a Chicken & Camembert pie … The pastry was crisp and fresh, and the filling was delicious … We sat in the courtyard and listened to a nearby harp player (yes, a harp player) while we devoured our morning tea. A very memorable event. Mike Noordermeer “ Best coffee we have had so far in Tasmania was from this bakery! I can see why the vanilla slice has won awards; they have nailed the balance of sweet but not too sweet. Steak pie was amazing! I got one fresh out of the oven. Kaye Eds “ Excellent bakery with all homemade cakes and the quiches are awesome in big or small! The small biscuits are loved by the kids. Really nice outdoor sitting area where the kids can run around and reduce the sugar rush. The coffee is good and the staff is friendly. Lovely stop over in Richmond for a snack or quick lunch!
