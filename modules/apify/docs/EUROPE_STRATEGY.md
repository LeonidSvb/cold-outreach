### European Categories (8 core)
Adapted for European climate and culture:

**Keep (highly relevant):**
1. electrician - universal need
2. plumber - universal need
3. hvac_contractor - heating more important than AC
4. roofing_contractor - weather protection critical
5. locksmith - security services popular
6. landscaper - especially UK, NL, DE
7. pest_control_service - universal
8. garage_builder - home improvement popular

**Remove (less relevant in EU):**
- air_conditioning_contractor - rare in Europe (cool climate)
- pool_cleaning_service - very few private pools
- tree_service - overlap with landscaper
- towing_service - different business model in EU

## My Recommendation

**Start with Option 1: GB + IE (English markets)**

**Why:**
1. **No language barrier** - can use same voice agent scripts as US/AU
2. **Proven market** - field services huge in UK
3. **High GDP** - Ireland especially ($99k per capita!)
4. **Easy to scale** - 1,600 quality leads for $3.04
5. **Quick validation** - test if European market responds well

**Alternative if you want scale:**
- Option 3 (UK only 2,000 leads) if you want to saturate one market first
- Option 2 (Nordic countries) if you want premium customers willing to pay more
