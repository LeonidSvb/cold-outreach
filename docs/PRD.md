# Cold Outreach AI Automation Platform - Product Requirements

Modular AI-powered system for processing 10K-30K leads/month with intelligent personalization and multi-channel outreach.

---

## 1. Vision & Users

### Primary User
Solo entrepreneur running AI automation/lead generation services

### Jobs-to-be-done (JTBD)
- When I have raw CSV leads from various sources, I want to enrich them with AI-powered insights, so I can create highly personalized outreach that converts.
- When I need to scale outreach to 10K+ leads/month, I want modular functions that work independently, so I can mix-match processing based on available data.

---

## 2. Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
- **High reply rate** and positive response rate leading to booked calls
- **Scalable processing** of 10K-30K leads/month (target: 30K/month by Q2 2025)

### Current Status (as of v8.4.0)
- **1.5K leads/campaign** with A/B testing framework
- **CSV upload + normalization** pipeline operational
- **Instantly integration** for cold email campaigns

For detailed changelog see: [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md)
