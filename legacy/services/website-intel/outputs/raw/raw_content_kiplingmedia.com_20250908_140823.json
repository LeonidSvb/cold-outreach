Read Now Nathan Eraut July 25, 2023 - Barbie marketing Barbie Marketing is Everywhere – And Places it’s Not By now you’ve probably seen some form of marketing for the Barbie movie, or at least heard someone mention it in conversation. How could you not? It’s estimated that the total marketing expenditure for the campaign was $150 million, more than the movie cost to make. Sure, the budget is big, but Warner Bros isn’t just dumping money into ads. The Barbie marketing team used a wide variety of unique, out-of-the-box marketing tactics including everything from brand partnerships to a Barbie-themed Airbnb in Malibu and much much more. The result? The marketing has now gone so mainstream that talking about it has become an internet inside joke, with a slew of people on social media posting photos of just about anything pink (think sunsets, random buildings) congratulating their marketing team on a job well done. With the movie earning $155 million in the US and another $182 million internationally through its opening weekend, it’s safe to say that the marketing was a success. In this blog, I’ll break down exactly what they did to achieve these results and how their unique strategy led to the creation of “the Barbie effect.” Read Now Nathan Eraut April 26, 2023 - Partner Network Advertising Diving Deep into Partner Network Advertising A 50% clickthrough rate might seem like every marketer’s dream, especially when paired with a $0.01 cost per click. Seeing this, you might think you have struck the advertising jackpot. But, as everyone knows, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is. When one of our TikTok campaigns showed abnormally “good” results like this, we decided to investigate why. The first thing we found was that we weren’t the only ones experiencing these weird results. Looking on Reddit, we found other TikTok advertisers sharing similar stories. We kept seeing Pangle pop up in posts, which immediately tipped us off to what was going on. Read Now Want More Insights? Let's start your project. Go Ahead. just click the button.

    "https://www.kiplingmedia.com/about": "About | Kipling Media | Full-Scale Canadian Marketing Agency About Us We are bridging the gap between stories & success.

    "https://www.kiplingmedia.com/inspiring-brand-story-telling": "How to Inspire Customers Through your Brand Story | Kipling Media Advertising Advertising / Brand / Marketing How to Inspire Customers Through your Brand Story Picture two different brands. Brand A and Brand B. Brand A is reliable, safe, and smart; It prefers safety over style and never strays outside of the lines. Brand B is different; it’s inspirational, resilient, cool, and constantly pushes the boundaries of what is achievable, never settling for less. Which brand inspires you? If you were to choose one to identify with, who would you choose? Crafting a powerful brand story is highly important for businesses and, if done correctly, can engage and inspire customers, converting them into loyal advocates. Nathan Eraut April 12, 2022 Table Of Contents The Psychology of Brand Storytelling Psychological research has shown that consumers rarely make purchase decisions based on facts and figures but instead primarily rely on emotion because most buying decisions are either too complex or too trivial to be made rationally. Storytelling is the most effective communication tool brands can use because great stories quickly grab attention and create emotional connections, leaving lasting impacts. Telling Personal Stories One excellent way of crafting a strong brand story is to focus on personal stories to which people can relate. A marketer’s job is to make people notice things they do not want or need to pay attention to. Focusing on people makes brand stories more relatable and thus more enticing; if a customer can relate to your story, they immediately form an emotional connection to your brand. Nike does an exceptional job of this; each Nike ad tells a story of triumph, empowerment, inclusivity, and inspiration, showing athletes and individuals alike triumphing over adversity and fighting for what they believe in. In 2018, Nike launched its “Dream Crazy” campaign . The campaign video tells the stories of famous athletes, including Usain Bolt, Lebron James, and Serena Williams, and their aspirations as youths. The video encourages its viewers to “dream crazy,” just as all famous athletes once did. Aside from famous athletes, the video also depicts several amateur athletes, such as Isaiah Bird, a young wrestler born without legs showing off his success, reinforcing that nothing is impossible when goals are set high. This campaign was highly successful, generating massive earned media and winning several awards . By tying their brand story to people’s unique stories of triumph, Nike successfully convinced millions of consumers to dream bigger, proving that telling personal stories is a reliable way to inspire and create emotional connections with consumers. Connecting to a Cause Another way of inspiring customers is by attaching your brand story to a powerful social cause. Now, more than ever, consumers are concerned with impact brands. In a world where social responsibility is at the forefront of society’s collective consciousness, consumers are highly inclined to be inspired by a brand whose social mission they believe in and can support. For example, Tentree is a Canadian men’s and women’s apparel company with an environmental mission . The company plants ten trees for each garment customers buy, hence the name. The company also sustainably sources all materials, addressing waste at each product lifecycle stage. Tentree’s mission empowers customers to make a positive impact in the world. As founder Derek Emsley stated: “At the end of the day, we’re not planting trees, it’s the person that’s purchasing the product. You want to feel it. We’re just the vehicle that’s making it possible.” Allowing customers to participate in your mission creates an immediate and deep emotional connection with the brand, empowering and inspiring customers. In only nine years of operation, Tentree has sold millions of products, planting over 73 million trees, a testament to the effectiveness of this strategy. Empowering Customers Finally, aspiration is an essential way of inspiring and connecting with customers. If a brand can make its story aspirational, it can encourage customers to identify with them. To illustrate, creativity is a highly sought-after skill; it implies intelligence, inventiveness, and originality, all things people aspire to. Apple embodies this better than any other brand. The company was founded on a creative philosophy, striving to “think different” . Apple challenges the status quo and demonstrates this through many of its product innovations. In everything they do, Apple demonstrates inventiveness and creativity and provides customers with the tools to embody this. This philosophy has created an image for customers to strive toward. If you want to inspire customers, tailor your brand story to be aspirational; make your brand embody something people can strive towards and provide them with the tools to achieve it. Creating a compelling brand story is essential for companies to excite, engage, and connect with customers. People are emotional decision-makers, and stories are a reliable way to draw on one’s emotions. To create a brand story, marketers must shift their communication focus away from products and focus on intangible features of a brand. How to Create a Brand Story Of the three brands previously mentioned, to whom were they most similar, brand A or B? Did they play it safe, or did they strive to become bigger than simply a company? Each brand previously discussed has something in common; they all established a powerful story that transformed their brands into catalysts of inspiration. When Nike asked customers to “dream crazy,” people listened. When Apple encouraged people to think differently, they did, and when Tentree told people that their next t-shirt could plant ten trees, millions of people became engaged. If you want to inspire your customers, use personal stories; this makes your brand more exciting and relatable. Give your brand a mission and empower your customers to support this mission. Purpose-driven brands are inspirational, and people enjoy feeling good about their purchases. Finally, strive to make your brand’s story aspirational; success will follow if your brand inspires people to achieve more and empowers them to do so. Ultimately, having a solid product is not enough to succeed in the long run. Today, brands must represent something meaningful to inspire people and form lasting relationships.

    "https://www.kiplingmedia.com/pr-101-creative-storytelling-pitches-how-to-write-press-release-for-event": "Creative Pitches | How To Write A Press Release For An Event Brand Brand / Business / Content / PR & Communications PR 101: Creative Storytelling Pitches & How To Write A Press Release For An Event Press release preparation is essential to corporate communications. They can help you generate brand awareness, improve SEO, shape public perception of your company, and share news about business developments. To get your story featured, you need a press release that is timely and targeted. It must also relate to the atmosphere in arts, politics, business, social movements, or other current events. Every brand has a story. All you need to do is find it, share it, and grow your business! Samantha Kroontje March 1, 2023 Table Of Contents Pitching to media: The basics of writing a press release Making a media list When disseminating your release, start with local media and move up to national or international outlets. Making a list of journalists with a demonstrated interest in your story’s topic is a great way to maximize your efforts while pitching. Start by finding articles about similar matters in publications that fit your brand – working from smaller media outlets towards more expansive networks. Be sure to indicate that you know whom you’re writing to (i.e., by mentioning their articles you’ve read about related topics) and why your story fits well with their publication. Always asking: why is this newsworthy today ? You need a compelling hook and an engaging story to rise above the noise of journalists’ inboxes. So, use a pithy, captivating hook right at the start of your release and imitate the headlines used by publications you’re pitching. Of course, editors are looking for a great story, but it’s certainly a bonus if the article is already written for them. Before writing a release, consider why your brand story matters now. Your product may be related to a more significant industry trend, or you can be covered for a feature article or as an expert with a timely opinion. If you’re a part of growing movements or trends, journalists can use your brand to comment on them – win, win! Writing a press release is about imparting relevant facts and weaving in a story. While releases should be impartial and fact-based, it is also vital that they maintain the style and voice that sets good press releases apart from the myriad of others stacking up on journalists’ desks. They should also be concise and direct, excluding all redundant information. Effectively delivering your pitches It can sometimes be challenging to tell a story engagingly while keeping a press release under a page. If there’s too much information to include and you are having trouble getting to the point of the story, an effective strategy may be to employ both in-email pitches along with a “master” press release attached. This strategy is especially effective if your press release strategy involves multiple angles targeted toward different journalists and media outlets. Here, the hook and the engaging writing should be in the email body. Couple that with a master press release that can accompany each unique story angle, and the network will have everything they need to tell your brand story. In that release, include a couple of conscious paragraphs about your organization, details about your product or event, relevant quotes, and any other information the writer may need to tell your story. Writing a press release: Follow the rules of releases The structure of a press release includes a headline, date, location, and note expressing that the story is “for immediate release.” Following these standard practices indicates to your reader that you are well-versed in press release preparation. For instance, most PR professionals attach a “– 30 –” at the end of the body of the writing. Its purpose was to indicate that the story was over, so journalists knew they weren’t missing a page in an age of hard copies and mail. While that is generally not a concern when communicating through email, following the traditional anatomy of a press release tells editors that you are experienced. How To Write A Press Release For An Event Creating Your Own Hook Event-based companies may have an easier time getting picked up for earned media than product-based companies, seeing that events can capitalize on the popularity of found stories (local happenings) in newspapers and magazines. But, throwing your own event/experiential activation, or participating in someone else’s, can be a great way to get in on these found stories while fostering loyalty and conversions amongst customers. Event marketing is a promotional strategy that involves live or online events and face-to-face contact between brands and potential customers. The type of event will depend on your product or service: a beverage company might sponsor a night at a club or throw a party, while a wealth management firm may host a seminar. Events could include sponsorship, pop-up shops, conferences, trade shows, or general product activations in high-traffic areas, like beaches and parks. While these events are all very different, they have one thing in common: they provide value to attendees. Whether it’s learning, recreation, entertainment, or just getting free stuff (a popular bonus in Kipling Media’s experience), your event is benefiting the community… somehow. And people are much more likely to use a product or service when they already know and trust the brand. How Event Marketing can Bolster your Brand Events make it easier to get earned PR. To make an appearance in your local newspaper (without putting money behind it), you need to have or create something newsworthy. AKA, why is X company relevant right now? Couple your event with an engaging press release and email pitch; you’re ready for print. It can foster trust amongst customers. In the age of false advertising and scam sites, people are reticent to try out products with which they aren’t familiar. Event marketing allows companies to provide value to potential customers in real-time. It’s one of the most fun ways to market your brand. Throwing a launch party or sponsoring an event space provides entertainment for your attendees and your team. You can plan your event to drive whatever conversion you need. Whether you need a boost to your email subscribers, social media following, or traditional check-out conversions, throwing or participating in an event is an excellent way to accomplish your goal. Say, for instance, you want to increase your Instagram following. You could offer visitors free products at your pop-up shop if they follow your account or share it with their audience. Or, you could offer a bigger prize to one winner. How To Write A Press Release For An Event: Wrapping Up Over time, you’ll perfect your press release writing skills and foster a network of “friendlies” in the journalism community who will run your stories. In turn, you’ll get lots of brand awareness and shape public perception of your business. Of course, the goal is to get your company news in the large national broadcast networks, but also consider the local, friends-and-family style blogs and papers. The more your story is told, the more discoverable your website becomes on search engines and the more clicks you get. In other words, the more buzz, the better.
